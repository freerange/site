              <h3>FutureLearn MOOC Platform</h3>
              <p><a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn</a>, a start-up founded by the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a>, approached us in April 2013 to help build the first UK platform for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">massive open online courses</a> (MOOCs). We jumped at the chance to get involved in such an exciting project!</p>
              <p>We played an important role in the team from the beginning; promoting a strong agile development culture as we helped ensure the platform was ready for the public launch in September 2013, and then again for the uncapped courses in January 2014.</p>
              <p>We think it’s a great project, with a great team, and we’re proud to have been involved.</p>

              <h3>Government Single Domain</h3>
              <p>We worked with <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">GDS</a> to help deliver the “Single Domain Project” for the UK government. The aim of the project is to deliver a <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2011/04/28/jfdi-gov-uk/">simpler, smaller, nimbler, cheaper and better gov.uk domain</a> for citizens and businesses to interact with the government and its services. This involves consolidating services from the multitude of existing government agency websites into a single, modern and usable system.</p>
              <p>Our specific role was to <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2011/10/27/the-vision-for-government-corporate-websites-in-the-single-domain-with-product-wireframes/">develop a platform</a> to allow the various government departments and agencies to communicate with the public about their policies, publications and goals in a uniform way to increase the clarify, usefulness and reusability of that information.</p>

              <h3>O2 #blue</h3>
              <p>In 2010 <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk">O2</a> asked us to help them explore new approaches to software development, database technologies and open collaboration with their customers. We built a working prototype / beta replicating one of <a href="http://bluebook.o2.co.uk">O2’s existing products</a> which let customers access text messages online. Working iteratively, we designed and built an API to securely expose this data, and #blue, a front-end application which consumed this data.</p>
              <p>We then worked with O2 to scale and integrate the service directly into O2’s data network, allowing it to support hundreds of thousands of customers, whilst remaining responsive to the feedback and direction provided by the users of #blue. After getting their development team up to speed, we handed over development of #blue to <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk">O2</a>.</p>

        <p>Using an agile/XP-based process is fundamental to our business. Much like the software it helps us to build, our process is always evolving and changing to meet the requirements and challenges with which we are presented.</p>
        <p>We urge you to <a href="#contact">talk to us</a> about your project. To give you an idea of how we work, our approach is framed by three guiding principles:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>We know that software is not a static artefact and so cannot be described by a static spec or plan.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>It needs to grow and evolve according to its environment, to best suit the needs of its users.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>These needs change over time, even as the software is being built.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>By getting early and regular feedback from users in real scenarios, we can identify and fulfill these needs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>By not compromising on quality and by avoiding unnecessary complexity, we can keep the system flexible and adaptable.</p>

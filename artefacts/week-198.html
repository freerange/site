          <p>Wuh-wuh-wuh-Weeknotes!<sup id="fnref:drop"><a class="footnote" href="#fn:drop">1</a></sup></p>
          <p>As ever, we split our brains and geographic loci between continuing work on Inside Government and GFR stuff, including <a href="https://harmonia.io">Harmonia</a>. You know the drill.</p>
          <h2 id="harmonia-is-almost-ready-ish">Harmonia is almost ready. Ish.</h2>
          <p>(<em><a href="https://harmonia.io">Harmonia</a> is a tool that <a href="/">we</a> have been building to help run our company. It knows about all the various tasks and chores that need to be done on a regular basis, from watering plants to paying taxes, and distributes them in a fair and timely way between everyone on our team. We’re getting it ready for other people – <a href="https://harmonia.io">maybe you?</a> – to use.</em>)</p>
          <p>It’s been a week of polishing, going through the signup process, tweaking designs and testing in various (<em>Internet-fscking-Explorer</em>) browsers, thinking about text and all sorts of other little bits of work, but we really are very, <em>very</em> close to being able to start inviting more people.</p>
          <p>I had hoped to have some nice screenshots to show you, but alas, we have not quite finished icing the cake yet.</p>
          <p>If you’re the kind of attractive, successful and nice-smelling individual who reads these weeknotes, you will have already realised that <a href="https://harmonia.io">Harmonia</a> is the organisational tool that you’ve been waiting for. However, for the rest of you: <a href="https://harmonia.io">I COMMAND YOU TO SIGN UP NOW</a>.</p>
          <p>That, friends, is a call-to-action.</p>
          <h2 id="inside-government">Inside Government</h2>
          <p>(<em><a href="/inside-government">Inside Government</a> is the second major part of the UK Government’s “Single Domain” project, bringing almost all departmental and organisational publishing onto a single “platform” which is modern, clear and designed with users in mind.</em>)</p>
          <p>With the first department moving to the single domain platform in a couple of weeks, most of our recent effort has been focussed towards getting scraped data from their old site imported into the new system.</p>
          <p>It’s been occasionally messy: a combination of stricter deployment controls, human error and <em>Microsoft-fscking-Excel</em> have made this a slower and more arduous procedure than I think anyone was hoping for.</p>
          <p>Anyway, hopefully the worse of the pain is over. <a href="/tom-ward">Tom</a> is back from a short holiday in Cornwall, and so I’m sure he will wrangle it successfully. I’ve certainly been reminded of some of the lessons I learned on previous projects (previous jobs, previous lives…) about importing data: <strong>get it out of human hands as soon as possible!</strong></p>
          <p>In the meantime, we continue to fight the good fight and try to keep code quality high and continue to deliver features where possible.</p>
          <h2 id="miscellany">Miscellany</h2>
          <p><a href="/chris-roos">Chris</a>, <a href="/james-mead">James M</a> and <a href="/james-adam">I</a> went for our monthly “GFR Social” on Tuesday, with impromptu guest appearances by our friends <a href="http://h-lame.com">Murray Steele</a> and <a href="http://po-ru.com">Paul Battley</a>. That pleasant sensation you awoke to on Wednesday was in no small part down to us having fully set the world to rights the night before, and yes – before you say anything else – you are <em>welcome</em>.</p>
          <p>Having an office is <em>a)</em> expensive, but <em>b)</em> very pleasant except <em>c)</em> when you have to do all sorts of stuff to satisfy the law. In this case, it’s arranging to get the electricity tested (“<em>is it the right colour? does it have somewhere to drain?</em>”), and making sure that the place isn’t a blazing inferno deathtrap waiting to happen the next time Chris decides to mull something. It’s boring, but it needs to be done.</p>
          <p><a href="/tom-ward">Tom</a> and <a href="/james-adam">I</a> have been playing <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424?mt=8">Letterpress</a>, along with the rest of the planet.</p>
          <h2 id="beyond-harmonia">Beyond Harmonia</h2>
          <p>While Harmonia’s functionality serves a very definite purpose for our company, it is also playing a more subtle (and in my opinion, <em>much</em> more important) role. We’ve been building Harmonia with the larger goal of learning how to develop our own products.</p>
          <p>(<em>If you’ve read us writing about ‘the company goal’, that’s a part of this. If you’ve read most of these weeknotes, you’ll recognise that this is pretty much always on my mind.</em>)</p>
          <p>For me, this is a vital step for the success of GFR. I’m confident that client work will be a significant part of our company’s portfolio for quite a while yet, but we need to get better at <em>being our own client</em> if we’re going to fulfil some of our longer-term goals.</p>
          <p>It’s hard to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)#Core_roles">product owner</a>. From a developer’s perspective, a good product owner is a source of decision making authority, and while we may challenge the reasoning behind some of those decisions, the product owner always gets the final say.</p>
          <p>When you are your own product owner, all of that external authority evaporates. Worse still, when you’re working as part of a pseudo-cooperative where nobody is (in any <em>real</em> sense) in charge, there’s no obvious alternative source of authority either! For me, <em>this</em> is the challenge that we – GFR – face, if we’re going to add a non-client string to our bow. We need to figure out how to be effective without those external forces.</p>
          <p>Will we succeed? Will we survive the importpocalypse? Will those faulty soldering irons that I keep plugged in near a precariously-balanced bucket of water be a problem?</p>
          <p>Find out next week.</p>
          <p>– James A.</p>

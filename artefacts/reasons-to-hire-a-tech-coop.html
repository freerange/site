      <p>Go Free Range are a software development co-operative and <a href="https://www.coops.tech/">we’re not the only one</a>. Why might you consider working with a co-operative for your next project, instead of a more traditional software development consultancy or a group of independent contractors? Here are some reasons</p>
      <h2 id="were-the-decision-makers">We’re the decision makers</h2>
      <p>As a worker cooperative everyone who works at Go Free Range owns a part of the business. If you hire us you’re working directly with people who have a strong vested interest in ensuring that your project is a success. We’re not just programmers, we’re business owners - we understand the reality of making difficult, pragmatic decisions and we have a unique perspective on the sometimes difficult trade-offs between engineering and the business. At Go Free Range every one of us has a say in who we work with and how we work with them - if we’re working with you it means we <em>really</em> want to. In short - your business is our business.</p>
      <h2 id="were-used-to-collaboration-and-communication">We’re used to collaboration and communication</h2>
      <p>Worker-owned cooperatives have no bosses. Each one of us is expected to make decisions about all aspects of the business. We’re used to communicating, having difficult conversations, making decisions that are <a href="http://sociocracy30.org/the-details/">good enough for now</a> and iterating on them later. When we work with you we bring these collaborative experiences to your projects and to the way we work with your team.</p>
      <h2 id="were-small-">We’re small …</h2>
      <p>The average size of a co-op within the CoTech network is under 10 members. Go Free Range have 3. This means that we generally only work with a single client at a time. We’re not swapping out “resources” on your project from week-to-week. As our client that means you’ll get to know us well and benefit from a working relationship that grows stronger and more productive over time.</p>
      <h2 id="but-were-part-of-something-bigger">… but we’re part of something bigger</h2>
      <p>As a member of <a href="https://www.coops.tech/">CoTech</a> we’re part of a wider network of fellow co-operatives that we trust and can work well with. If we can’t take on your project because we don’t have the right skills or enough time, we may know someone who can. And if there’s some skills your project needs to compliment the development that we provide at Go Free Range, there’s a <a href="https://www.coops.tech/#services">good chance</a> we can work with someone who has them.</p>
      <h2 id="were-experienced">We’re experienced</h2>
      <p>## We’re cost-effective ## We’re sustainable</p>

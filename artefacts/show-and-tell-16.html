          <p>We were a bit thinner on the ground than usual for this meeting with only 5 of us, but at least that meant that we had plenty of space for all of us at GFRHQ.</p>
          <h2 id="tracy-island">Tracy Island</h2>
          <p>As per usual <a href="https://twitter.com/beng">Ben G</a> is in the middle of another fun project for his children. He’s decided to try to build a scale model of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Island">home of International Rescue</a>. His children are big fans of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a> and Ben discovered that someone has built <a href="http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/thunderbirds-tracy-island/">a World containing Tracy Island</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
          <p>So rather than design Tracy Island from scratch, Ben has extracted horizontal cross-sectional images from this World. He’s filled in these layer images (to remove all the voids) and identified the <em>outline</em> of the island in each layer. The plan is to laser-cut these layers out of 3mm plywood sheets and glue them together to make a large scale model of the island.</p>
          <p>Ben wants to avoid the island being too heavy, so based on the assumption that the outline of the island gets smaller as you go upwards, he’s planning on adding a scaled-down outline of the layer below to each layer as an <em>inside</em> edge. This should result in a hollowed-out version.</p>
          <p>He also wants to keep the costs down and so he’s contemplating trying to do some tessellation of his layers to minimize waste. Anyway, it all sounds great to me - watch this space!</p>
          <h2 id="minecraft-logic-gates">Minecraft Logic Gates</h2>
          <p>Ben also gave us a bit of an introduction to Minecraft. For a game that’s become so popular with kids and is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/09/report-microsoft-to-buy-minecraft-developer-mojang-for-2-billion/">reportedly worth $2 billion</a>, it’s pretty amazing that it has such a clunky user interface. Starting it up (at least on Mac OS X) shows two terminal windows with lots of incomprehensible logging output and then displays a launcher GUI app. The latter even gives you the option of selecting the JVM you want to use!</p>
          <p>Anyway, Ben started the app in <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Creative">creative mode</a> and showed us a bunch of things in a world he’d knocked up. Having just worked through the Nand2Tetris book at <a href="http://london.computation.club">London Computation Club</a>, I was most interested in the <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Basic_logic_gates">logic gates</a> made using <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone">redstone</a>. It’s fascinating how people have come up with these “circuits” using relatively few initial components.</p>
          <p>Ben also showed how to build a simple “machine” using <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Piston">pistons</a> to generate a repeating sequence of four notes. Finally he showed us videos of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1fOED0vC8">pianola</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWkgiTvMZKQ">music sequencer</a>. Amazing stuff!</p>
          <h2 id="nand2tetris-hardware-simulator">Nand2Tetris Hardware Simulator</h2>
          <p>I did a little demo of where I’ve got to with <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/nand2tetris.js/tree/master">my JavaScript version</a> of the <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/software.php">Nand2Tetris hardware simulator</a>. The authors of the book provide this as a Java app which allows you to run test scripts against the chips you design using their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">hardware description language</a> (HDL). The user interface for this Java app is pretty clunky, so I thought it might be interesting to build a better one in JavaScript and run it in the browser.</p>
          <p>So far I’ve been focussing on a command-line version of the tool. I’ve used <a href="http://pegjs.org/">PEG.js</a> to define “grammars” for the test scripts and the HDL files. The HDL file for a chip is parsed into an abstract syntax tree (AST) which is then transformed into a “chip definition” model. A chip definition can have either a built-in implementation or be implemented by one or more chips. These implementations are recursively resolved into more chip definitions parsing the HDL files for each as appropriate.</p>
          <p>The graph of chip definitions is then converted into instances of <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">backbone.js</a> models representing each chip and connections between their pins are “made” using <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Events">backbone event handlers</a>. Once the connections have all been made, the changing of an input value cascades through the event handlers, eventually changing the values of the relevant outputs.</p>
          <p>I’ve got the command-line version of the tool working for simple chips and I’m halfway through making it work with multi-bit busses. Once I’ve got that working, I hope to move on to running the code in a browser and building a nice user interface for it.</p>
          <h2 id="sicp-distilled">SICP Distilled</h2>
          <p><a href="http://www.thattommyhall.com/">Tom H</a> gave us a quick tour through his <a href="http://www.sicpdistilled.com/">SICP Distilled</a> site which he’s recently made public as part of his <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1751759988/sicp-distilled">Kickstarter</a>. Apparently <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10178544">this</a> made the front page of Hacker News on Sunday!</p>
          <p>He’s ended up doing a bit of a re-write of the <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">original book</a> and uses Clojure instead of Scheme in his example code. Tom said he’s most proud of the <a href="http://www.sicpdistilled.com/section/2-escher/">Escher section of chapter 2</a> and the <a href="http://www.sicpdistilled.com/section/4.1/">Metacircular Evaluator section of chapter 4</a>. Unfortunately my understanding of Clojure is fairly limited, so I struggled a bit to follow along, but it certainly looks like an impressive bit of work.</p>
          <h2 id="terraframe">Terraframe</h2>
          <p>Next Tom told us about <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> which is a <a href="https://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a>-like infrastructure-as-code system with its own description language (DL). According to Tom the Terraform DL suffers like Puppet’s from not being a general purpose language <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. The <a href="http://edcanhack.com/">author of Terraframe</a> isn’t keen on the Terraform DL, but really likes the underlying engine, so he’s implemented <a href="https://github.com/eropple/terraframe">Terraframe</a> which provides a Ruby DSL to output JSON conforming to the Terraform specification format.</p>
          <p>Tom’s been using Terraframe on his current project and is really impressed by it. He also uses <a href="https://www.packer.io/">Packer</a> to build <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html">AMIs</a>. These AMIs are used to build machines which are then configured using a simple Puppet recipe with a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-masterless-puppet-environment-on-ubuntu-14-04">masterless Puppet setup</a>.</p>
          <h2 id="octopress-to-middleman-conversion">Octopress to Middleman Conversion</h2>
          <p>Tom wrapped things up by telling us about how he’s recently converted <a href="http://www.thattommyhall.com/">his blog</a> from <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> to <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>. He was surprised that the conversion was very straightforward. He’s using a slightly modified version of the <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> theme and a couple of Middleman plugins, <a href="https://github.com/middleman-contrib/middleman-sync">middleman-sync</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leighmcculloch/middleman-cdn">middleman-cdn</a> <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> to deploy to AWS’ S3 & CloudFront.</p>
          <p>Tom liked being able to use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/">GitHub-flavoured Markdown</a> and the automatic page reloading when editing your site locally. Anyway the end result looks very nice!</p>
          <h2 id="next-meeting">Next Meeting</h2>

          <p>Thanks to everyone for coming. Hope to see you next time.</p>

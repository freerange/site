          <h1 id="week-170">Week 170</h1>
          <p>It’s been another fairly quiet week at GFRHQ, with <a href="/james-adam">James A</a> out of the office on Monday and Tuesday and <a href="/tom-ward">Tom</a> jetting off to Krakow on Wednesday for <a href="http://railsberry.com/">Railsberry</a>.</p>
          <p>In <a href="/week-169">week-169</a> James A touched on us losing sight of some of the larger goals we have as GFR. I agree and wonder if we’re being a bit extreme in our approach: previously, it was <em>all</em> about the client work, then it was <em>all</em> about discussing our future and just recently it’s been <em>all</em> about going solo(ish) and working on whatever might interest us. Although I’ve definitely enjoyed working on my toy bookmarking project and joining in with James A’s excellent work on <a href="/printer">Printer</a> we need to make sure we do this while keeping the bigger picture in mind. We should all be in the office next week so we’ll pick up on it then.</p>
          <h2 id="printer">Printer</h2>
          <p>A few different things have happened in Printer land this week. Not least of which is having 57 people say they’d be interested in buying a pre-configured kit of parts to build their own printer! In order to meet demand, James A has spent quite some time investigating how we might buy these components in bulk.</p>
          <p>James A and Printer have also made two fairly high profile appearances this week. The first was at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/iotlondon/events/58233312/">Internet of Things meetup 7</a> and the second was in the Wired magazine article, “<a href="http://www.wired.com/design/2012/04/your-twitter-feed-as-newspaper-a-look-at-the-tiny-printer-trend/">Your Twitter Feed as Newspaper: A Look at the Tiny Printer Trend</a>” by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/doingitwrong">Tim Maly</a>. James has put an awful lot of work into this project so it’s great that we’re (yeah, that’s right, <em>we’re</em> :-)) getting this sort of coverage.</p>
          <h2 id="roosmarks">Roosmarks</h2>
          <p>I finally gave in to <a href="/james-mead">James M</a>’s constant pressure and pushed the source of <a href="https://github.com/chrisroos/roosmarks">roosmarks to github</a>. I’ve also spent quite a bit of time getting the functionality and style to a point where it doesn’t cause me too much pain in my day to day use. You can see my copy of <a href="https://roosmarks.herokuapp.com/">roosmarks on heroku</a> or follow the <a href="https://github.com/chrisroos/roosmarks#readme">instructions in the README</a> to get your own copy up and running. <em>NOTE</em> I’m not paying for roosmarks to be hosted on Heroku so every now and then a request will take some time to respond as it waits for the server process to boot.</p>
          <p>I managed to lose about a day getting roosmarks running on my <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> VPS so that I can play around with remotely developing from my <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/">Chromebook</a>.</p>
          <h2 id="p11ds">P11Ds</h2>
          <p>These are a massive pain in the arse. Fact. Even though I’m almost 100% certain that us filling out P11Ds wouldn’t change the amount of Tax or NICs we (as a company, or individually) pay, we’re still supposed to complete them. We’d originally planned to submit nil returns but then I spent a couple of hours reading the <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/exb/a-z/a/index.htm">A-Z list of Expenses and Benefits</a> and started to get a little worried that we were intentionally mis-informing HMRC. In the end we’ve asked our accountant (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/stuartjones">Stuart Jones</a> at <a href="http://www.3caonline.com/">3CA</a>) to complete them for us. We’ve also spoken to Stuart about the possibility of working together to create a simple tool that might make P11D generation easier for <a href="http://www.freeagent.com/">Free Agent</a> users. I have no idea whether there’s any mileage in this but we’ll see how it goes.</p>
          <h2 id="miscenanigans">Miscenanigans</h2>
          <p>James M took delivery of his <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Rasberry Pi</a> on Wednesday and promptly got it <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/floehopper/status/193011738545897473">set-up in the office</a>. He initially installed a <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> distro but I don’t think that comes with Ruby so he’s in the process of moving over to <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>.</p>
          <p>Tom had a momentary bout of whachoo-doin-you-crazy-fool and got <a href="https://github.com/tomafro/jruby-mustache-java">stuck into some Java</a>, albeit with JRuby, at the beginning of the week.</p>
          <p>James M took his HSBC dongle breaking as the sign he needed to go and buy a 70 piece toolkit from Maplins in order to poke around inside it.</p>
          <p>James A might not be around but pointed out that the <a href="http://bootstrapd.com/">bootstrapd</a> conference might be something of interest.</p>

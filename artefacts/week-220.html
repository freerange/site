          <h1 id="week-220">Week 220</h1>
          <p>This was another short week, post-Easter, and a pretty quiet one at that, especially as <a href="/chris-roos">Chris</a> was away on holiday in Australia. I hope you’re having fun, Chris.</p>
          <h2 id="ssl-on-a-single-sub-domain">SSL on a single sub-domain</h2>
          <p>Having been away on holiday myself for a couple of weeks (trying hard not to look at a computer), it took me quite a while to catch up with what’s been going on. To ease myself back into some technical work, I decided to pick up a relatively benign looking card about enabling SSL for one of our sub-domains.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately as far as I can tell it’s not possible to enable SSL for a single sub-domain while not responding to SSL on the base domain or on the other sub-domains. Looking on the bright side, I learnt a fair bit about the SSL extension, <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/NameBasedSSLVHostsWithSNI">Server Name Indication</a>, and the X.509v3 extension for <a href="http://wiki.cacert.org/FAQ/subjectAltName">Subject Alternative Name</a>.</p>
          <h2 id="p35-submission">P35 submission</h2>
          <p><a href="/tom-ward">Tom</a> has been grappling with the mysteries of submitting our P35 to HMRC via the <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/payerti/payroll/bpt/index.htm">Basic PAYE Tools</a>. It didn’t help that the HMRC server appeard to be down or overloaded for much of a 24-hour period, but he got it submitted in the end.</p>
          <h2 id="ruby-manor-4">Ruby Manor 4</h2>
          <p><a href="/james-adam">James A</a> has been busy with preparations for <a href="http://rubymanor.org/4/">Ruby Manor 4</a>. Regrettably, I’m not going to be able to make it this year. It’s a shame because the <a href="http://rubymanor.org/4/#schedule">list of talks</a> looks excellent and the venue sounds great. I hope all the attendees enjoy the conference and appreciate the effort that James A, <a href="https://twitter.com/tomstuart">Tom Stuart</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hlame">Murray</a> have put into it.</p>
          <h2 id="launch">3-2-1 launch?</h2>
          <p>Tom has been doing some thinking the experience that he and Chris gained on <a href="/week-218#project-los-roques">Project Los Roques</a> and how we might offer a similar short engagement to prospective clients as a “product”. In particular he’s been thinking about how we could have some kind of skeleton application which would include common libraries to save time setting them up.</p>
          <h2 id="minitest-extension">MiniTest extension</h2>
          <p>In another vain attempt to do something short and self-contained, I went back to try to finish off some changes to <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest">MiniTest</a> which I started a while ago. The idea was to provide a robust way to run a single MiniTest test by specifying a file and a line number with the idea that this making editor integration easier.</p>
          <p>I have the basics of it working, but I’ve been struggling to come up with the best way to make it available: pull request to MiniTest, a MiniTest extension gem, or something else. Even though MiniTest provides a number of extension points, it’s pretty awkward to define a new test runner extending the functionality of the existing one.</p>
          <h2 id="heylist">Heylist!</h2>
          <p>James A has also been keeping an eye on <a href="http://heyli.st/">HeyList!</a>. If you want to tap into the <a href="/say-hello-to-heylist">real pulse</a> of the conference, you might want to consider following the <a href="https://twitter.com/rubymanor/ruby-manor-4">Ruby Manor 4 list</a> which currently has 107 members. It’ll be interesting to see how many people use the list on Saturday and how useful they found it.</p>
          <h2 id="printer-kits">Printer kits</h2>
          <p>After a short delay due to temporary difficulties getting hold of some <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer/wiki/Component-list#or-arduino-ethernet-6533-42">Arduino Ethernets</a>, James A has sent out a few more <a href="http://exciting.io/printer">Printer kits</a>. I’m looking forward to seeing what people do with them.</p>
          <p>Anyway, that’s your lot for this week. Have a great weekend!</p>
          <p>– James</p>

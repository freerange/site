          <h1 id="week-412">Week 412</h1>
          <p>We agreed on a couple of goals for this week: to make some progress on our website and to spend at least a day working on anything that interests us.</p>
          <p>We worked from <a href="http://www.theofficegroup.co.uk/">The Office Group</a> locations in Whitechapel and Bloomsbury as well as from our respective homes.</p>
          <p>We both took the afternoon off on Thursday so that <a href="/james-mead">James</a> and <a href="http://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/">Chris L</a> could pop over to see the houseboat. We had an enjoyable afternoon of food, wandering, chatting and drinking.</p>
          <p>We met <a href="http://hookline.tv/">Hookline</a> in the fancy <a href="http://www.thehospitalclub.com/">Hospital Club</a> on Friday for a general catch-up. It sounds as though they’ve been making good progress in trying to work out a direction for the product we’ve been building with them.</p>
          <h2 id="website">Website</h2>
          <p>We spent about half a day working on our website together. We have a number of improvements in the backlog that never seem to get prioritised; agreeing to work on it together allowed us to get through a good few of them. While we both thought this worked quite well we agreed that it would’ve been even better if we’d spent more time on it.</p>
          <h2 id="fun-times---otp">Fun times - OTP</h2>
          <p>I spent some time investigating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password">One-Time Passwords</a> (OTP). I use <a href="https://www.authy.com/">Authy</a> to generate OTPs for a number of sites/services but didn’t really have any idea how it worked. I started out reading about the subject before diving in and starting to implement the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4226.txt">HOTP spec</a> in Ruby. I’ve made some progress and hope to continue working on it next week.</p>
          <h2 id="fun-times---chess-and-raspberry-pi">Fun times - Chess and Raspberry Pi</h2>
          <p>James split his time between chess hardware hacking and Raspberry Pi playing.</p>
          <p>He continued to make progress on wiring up his chess board before getting stuck. He then moved on to configuring a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/">Raspberry Pi Zero</a> to act as a combined webcam and temperature and humidity sensor. It sounds as though getting this working somewhat made up for the problems James ran into when wiring up the chess board.</p>
          <h2 id="platform-cooperatives-conference">Platform Cooperatives Conference</h2>
          <p>Oliver at <a href="https://open.coop/">Open Coop</a> brought the <a href="https://2017.open.coop/">Open:2017</a> conference to our attention. We don’t know much about “Platform Cooperatives” but it looked interesting enough that we decided to buy a couple of tickets. It’s being held at <a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/icce/">Goldsmiths</a> in February next year and tickets are still available.</p>
          <p>Having done a bit more investigation in the course of writing this post, it looks as though the (relatively lengthy) <a href="https://medium.com/@trebors/platform-cooperativism-vs-the-sharing-economy-2ea737f1b5ad#.r8l8laoqa">“Platform Cooperativism vs. the Sharing Economy” blog post</a> contains some background behind the term.</p>
          <h2 id="digital-outcomes--specialists-2">Digital Outcomes & Specialists 2</h2>
          <p>We finalised our submission for the <a href="https://digitalmarketplace.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/10/digital-outcomes-and-specialists-2-is-now-open-apply-to-supply-your-services/">Digital Outcomes and Specialists 2 framework</a>. We both agreed that we were happy to stick with the same offerings that we listed in DOS1 which made the process <em>slightly</em> less cumbersome.</p>
          <p>That’s about all for this week. Until next time.</p>
          <p>– Chris</p>

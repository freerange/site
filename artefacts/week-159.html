          <p>Somewhere in Brazil a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">butterfly flapped its wings</a> and the great goddess, <a href="http://github.com/freerange/harmonia">Harmonia</a>, chose <a href="/james-mead">me</a> to write the week-notes this week. Although she’s nominated me plenty of times for other company tasks, in an almost petulant demonstration of the <a href="http://rubymanor.org/3/videos/a_random_walk/">unpredictability of randomness</a>, this is the first time she’s picked me to note the week.</p>
          <h3 id="gov-uk">Gov UK</h3>
          <p>Having completed our work on <a href="http://hashblue.com">#blue</a> with <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk">O2</a>, the whole team was back at Aviation House this week working on the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall">Whitehall-facing</a> part of the government <a href="http://gofreerange.com/government-single-domain">single domain project</a>. The big event of the week was undoubtably <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/01/31/beta/">the release of the beta version</a> of the <a href="http://gov.uk">citizen-facing</a> part of the project. We offer hearty congratulations to our comrades in the citizen team.</p>
          <p>It feels really positive that such a high-profile government IT project is being delivered in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development">incremental and iterative</a> way using an <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/colophon-beta/">open source stack</a> and very refreshing that it’s already <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/02/01/govuk-beta-day1/">adapting in response to user feedback</a>. We’d really encourage everyone to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tour">take the new site for a spin</a>. The buzz in the office and all the <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/fttechhub/2012/02/beta-gov-uk/">positive</a> <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/01/with-govuk-british-government.html">media</a> <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-02/01/gov-uk-enters-beta">coverage</a> has certainly injected extra enthusiasm for getting the Whitehall app ready for release.</p>
          <h3 id="whitehall">Whitehall</h3>
          <p>Now that more real content is being added to the system, <a href="/jason-cale">Jase</a> has been working hard to iterate on the design and make things more consistent across the site. <a href="http://twitter.com/neillyneil">Neil</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo_pete/">Pete</a> continue to marshall <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/367813">stories</a> as well as throngs of writers across government who are busy entering data into the system. The Whitehall app aims to put government <em>policy</em> centre stage, but one challenge that Neil and his posse face is that there is no single clear definition of <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/02/03/government-policy-a-spotters-guide/">what constitutes government policy</a>.</p>
          <p>This week we bade farewell (or hopefully only <em>au revoir</em>) to <a href="http://experthuman.com/">Tom S</a> who has been a very welcome addition to the <a href="/">GFR</a> team for the last few weeks. We wish him good luck in his new ventures and hope we get the chance to work with him again in the future. We’re also looking forward to working more closely with members of the citizen team, now that their release is out the way, as we begin to handover development of the app to those with a more permanent association with the <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a>.</p>
          <p>The week was nicely rounded off by our first <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/pull/3">Github pull request</a> from a member of the public. May there be many more!</p>

          <p>It looks like <a href="/james-adam">James A</a> has <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lazyatom/status/163355745734246400">renewed his interest</a> in persuading his computer to talk to <a href="https://github.com/lazyatom/ThermalSD">very small printers</a> - I only hope <a href="/timmy">Timmy</a> isn’t too jealous. <a href="/jason-cale">Jase</a> has somehow found time amidst his copious ceramic throwing to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jasoncale/status/164354174547525635">put together</a> <a href="http://instagr.am/p/mjofO/">an EP</a>. I’ve been trying, but failing, to keep up with a recent surge of interest in <a href="http://github.com/floehopper/mocha">mocha</a>. I’m curious whether this burst of activity has anything to do with the renewed interest in using a more <a href="http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/11/15/early-access-beta-of-objects-on-rails-now-available-2/">object-oriented approach</a> to developing Rails apps. <a href="/tom-ward">Tom W</a> managed to wrestle <a href="/">Go Free Range’s</a> Annual Return into <a href="http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/06789592">submission</a> (to Companies House) and <a href="/chris-roos">Chris</a> continued to astound me with his incredible <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/commit/7b4a62a85802a4e9a6da0bf2f75861aabbcbdd1d">attention to detail</a>.</p>
          <p>Adieu.</p>

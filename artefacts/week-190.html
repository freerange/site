          <p>This week’s notes may not be as comprehensive as usual, because I was caught up with moving house and then away in Sardinia<sup id="fnref:sardinia"><a class="footnote" href="#fn:sardinia">1</a></sup> – I’m still knee-deep in boxes. Apologies to those concerned if I’ve missed something important.</p>
          <p>The week started with the annoying incident of the burglar(s) in the night-time - there was a break-in at our office and some of our stuff was stolen. Needless to say, sorting this out took up a lot of <a href="/chris-roos">Chris</a>, <a href="/tom-ward">Tom</a> & <a href="/james-adam">James A</a>’s time. Anyway the police are on the case and we await developments…</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we’ve continued to beaver way on <a href="http://inside-inside-gov.tumblr.com/">Inside Government</a> with our <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">GDS</a> team-mates. It feels as if there’s been a welcome increase in feedback with a round of user testing focussing on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist">specialist guides</a>, lots of content being bulk-imported from existing sites, and more editorial people using the publishing tool for real.</p>
          <p>After the server problems we had last week, <a href="/james-adam">James A</a> changed <a href="/printer">Printer</a> <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer/commit/4c53a2dbc36572631f7386fb55c9334ae882215e">to use PostgreSQL</a> instead of Redis which has led to a significant drop in memory use on our Linode box. And earlier in the week I noticed <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools">Google Webmaster Tools</a> was reporting a lot of 404s & 500s on <a href="/">our website</a>, so I spent a while trying to sort that out. Today I spent some time trying to add <a href="https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/blob/master/lib/rack/contrib/mailexceptions.rb">Rack::MailExceptions</a> to give us better visibility of such problems.</p>
          <p>James A has also been exploring different approaches for marrying <a href="http://github.com/freerange/harmonia">Harmonia</a>’s framework-agnostic domain model with a persistence mechanism. He’s tried out a few approaches in different branches and has come to the conclusion that “Rails and ‘Good OO’ are definitely at odds and sacrifices on both sides will be required; the key is really understanding those sacrifices so they don’t cause friction when we come back to the code later”.</p>
          <p>While I was away I made some more progress on a significant new release of <a href="http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs">Mocha</a> which should mean an end to monkey-patching the <a href="https://github.com/test-unit/test-unit">Test::Unit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest">MiniTest</a> test libraries. I ran into a lot of problems with VM “power-down” exceptions on <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis-CI</a> while doing this, but as always the Travis team were very <a href="https://twitter.com/travisci/status/243277263091671040">responsive</a> & <a href="https://twitter.com/travisci/status/243030960671707136">helpful</a>. I also pushed out a patch release of Mocha to cope with new test library releases.</p>
          <p>This week I also saw the <a href="https://github.com/travisbot">Travis CI bot</a> in action. I received a Mocha <a href="https://github.com/freerange/mocha/pull/101">pull request</a> already stamped as having built successfully on Travis. I was able to review the pull request in a matter of minutes and push the “merge” button with confidence - altogether a very streamlined process.</p>
          <p>Last, but definitely not least, we’re still struggling to get some momentum behind <a href="/">GFR</a> projects and to make progress towards our company goal. It sounds as if there are a few different opinions about why this is so and how we might make things better. But hopefully we can have a good chat about this when we all get together in the office this coming week.</p>

                <p>I was a hanger-on at the <a href="http://ecvp2012.uniss.it/">European Conference on Visual Perception</a>, which gave me the chance to observe the workings of an academic conference and compare it with techie conferences I’ve attended. I went to the session on <a href="http://openscience.org">Open Science</a> which had some interesting talks.&nbsp;<a class="reversefootnote" href="#fnref:sardinia">↩</a></p>

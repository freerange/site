          <p>Unfortunately I was off sick all week again this week. However, I did improve enough towards the end of the week so that I was able to do some work on a presentation about <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html">pair programming</a> which we’d been asked to give at <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn</a>. In particular it was a good opportunity to re-read sections of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0321278658">eXtreme Programming explained</a> by Kent Beck.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile <a href="/chris-roos">Chris</a> was at FutureLearn all week except Wednesday doing lots of pairing. He worked with <a href="http://chrislowis.co.uk/">Chris L</a> to reduce some of the noise of intermittent failures reported in <a href="https://www.honeybadger.io/">Honeybadger</a>. Although it took them a while, the result (using Honeybadger filters instead of <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Middleware">Sidekiq middleware</a>) is definitely simpler to understand.</p>
          <p>He also worked with <a href="http://ricardolopes.net/">Ricardo</a> at the end of the week trying to address a problem where the queue processing machines were using a lot of RAM. They investigated removing <a href="https://github.com/tobiassvn/sidetiq">Sidetiq</a> in favour of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">Cron</a>, in the hope that having fewer moving parts would help make it easier to understand what was going on.</p>
          <p>Both Chris & I worked from home on Wednesday mainly working through various admin tasks. We also caught up with each other using a <a href="http://www.google.com/hangouts/">Google Hangout</a> which was useful, although I think we’re both missing having our own office.</p>
          <p>Having cancelled our January <a href="/show-and-tell-events">Show and Tell</a> event, because it would’ve been in the middle of packing up the Worship Street office, we were really keen to find a venue to hold the February event. To this end, we booked a small room at the <a href="http://starofkings.co.uk/">Star of Kings pub</a> near Kings Cross.</p>

          <h1 id="week-285">Week 285</h1>
          <p>We spent the vast majority of the week trying to make progress on the credit union front. After Monday, in an effort to retain momentum, we made a conscious effort to avoid working on admin tasks before 4pm each day.</p>
          <h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
          <p>Although this worked reasonably well, I think it worked best when we came up with <em>well-defined</em> tasks in our credit union <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> project. When the next tasks were less well-defined, I found it more tempting to go and work on the well-defined GFR admin tasks.</p>
          <p>It’s easy to think that time spent writing up tasks and prioritising them is wasted or somehow less efficient than actually working on tasks, but this was a good reminder of the importance of considering the bigger picture and recognising the value of these internal “planning” sessions.</p>
          <h2 id="credit-union">Credit union</h2>
          <p>We’ve continued to keep daily notes on our progress:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="/project-credit-union-day-5">Day 5</a> - Monday
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="/project-credit-union-day-6">Day 6</a> - Tuesday
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="/project-credit-union-day-7">Day 7</a> - Wednesday
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="/project-credit-union-day-8">Day 8</a> - Thursday
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="/project-credit-union-day-9">Day 9</a> - Friday
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>It was good to <a href="/project-credit-union-day-6#manifesto">revisit our motivations</a> for working on the project and to make our requirements for a <a href="/project-credit-union-day-8#minimum-viable-account">minimum viable account</a> more explicit. It also felt like a positive step to send off our application to <a href="/project-credit-union-day-8#study-group-application">become an ABCUL study group</a>, although it’s rather disappointing that we haven’t heard anything back from them yet.</p>
          <p>Although much of the time it has felt like wading through treacle, it does feel as if we’re gradually homing in on what’s possible.</p>
          <h2 id="day-notes">Day notes</h2>
          <p>Writing the daily notes has been an interesting experiment. I think it has been a good way to keep ourselves honest and focussed, but I do wish it didn’t take me quite so long to write stuff for public consumption!</p>
          <p>I <em>have</em> been getting better at it; or at least I have been getting a bit <em>faster</em>, but I still find it more of a struggle than I would like. Hopefully practice will make perfect…</p>
          <h2 id="friends">Friends</h2>
          <p><a href="http://codon.com/">Tom Stuart</a> was away at the end of the week attending the <a href="http://kickstartacademy.io/courses/practical-object-oriented-design">Practical Object-Oriented Design course</a> run by <a href="http://www.mattwynne.net/">Matt Wynne</a> and <a href="http://www.sandimetz.com/">Sandi Metz</a> (author of the <a href="http://www.poodr.com/">POODR book</a>).</p>
          <p>We were pleased to have the company of <a href="http://chrislowis.co.uk">Chris Lowis</a> on Thursday. Chris very kindly gave us a couple of chilli plants which he’d grown from seed. Hopefully we can keep them alive long enough for them to bear fruit!</p>
          <h2 id="venture-capital">Venture capital</h2>
          <p>Chris also reminded me of a conversation we’d had a few weeks ago: it’s my contention that the standard venture capital model of funding start-ups is broken, at least in the context of a <em>truely</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup">lean start-up</a></p>
          <p>The traditionally VC funding process feels very “big bang” and almost diametrically opposed to the ideals of an agile/lean approach. We pondered whether a GFR-flavoured credit union might be able to address this by offering lighter-weight, shorter rounds of “funding”.</p>
          <h2 id="vanilla">Vanilla</h2>
          <p>It also was nice to take advantage of this week’s lovely weather and meet-up with the likes of <a href="http://h-lame.com/">Murray</a> for some enjoyable outdoor lunches.</p>
          <p>I remember an interesting discussion about static websites we had one lunchtime - I’d forgotten that Murray is running the original <a href="http://www.vanillasite.at/">vanilla</a> (as opposed to <a href="https://github.com/lazyatom/vanilla-rb">vanilla.rb</a> which we use on this site) on his personal website and it was interesting to learn a bit more about its origins. In researching this a bit further I’ve also just stumbled upon <a href="http://interblah.net/">James Adam</a>’s <a href="http://interblah.net/introducing-vanilla-rb">introduction to vanilla.rb</a> which is well worth a read.</p>
          <p>Murray’s in the process of switching another website over to use <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>, so we’ll be interested to hear how he gets on with that.</p>
          <p>Anyway, that’s all for now.</p>
          <p>– James.</p>

          <p>With Chris & I having been abroad quite a bit, this was the first time we’d run a Show & Tell event since December last year. Since we no longer have the luxury of an office, I decided that I’d try my luck hosting the event in a pub. So on 11th May, a select group of four of us met up at <a href="http://www.thepeasant.co.uk/">The Peasant</a>.</p>
          <h2 id="phaser">Phaser</h2>
          <p><a href="https://twitter.com/knotnicky">Nicky</a> had been working her way through the <a href="http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game">tutorial</a> for the <a href="http://phaser.io">Phaser HTML5 game framework</a>. She explained a bit about the framework and showed us the game she’d built which was pretty cool.</p>
          <p>It turns out that Nicky is a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense">Tower Defence</a> games and her longer-term goal is to build one, but with aesthetics like (or as good as) those of <a href="http://www.monumentvalleygame.com/">Monument Valley</a>. She had made a start but had got a bit stuck. We talked a bit about other approaches and frameworks, but I’m not sure we were much help!</p>
          <h2 id="minecraft">Minecraft</h2>
          <p><a href="https://twitter.com/beng">Ben</a> explained how the cool kids have moved on from <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mods">modding Minecraft</a> by patching the JAR file to modifying a vanilla version of Minecraft by entering <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands">commands</a> into the <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chat#Chat">multi-player chat window</a>.</p>
          <h3 id="commands">Commands</h3>
          <p>In his first demo, he entered a couple of commands so that every time the player jumped a block was <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands#summon">summoned</a> to appear immediately underneath its position. In this way he showed how a player could “build” impressive 3D structures simply by moving around and jumping.</p>
          <h3 id="command-block">Command block</h3>
          <p>In the next demo he showed how a single command can be associated with a <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Command_Block">command block</a>. The command can then be activated by the player using Redstone power. He showed us how he’d created a set of command blocks to make some <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chicken">chickens</a> follow the player around.</p>
          <h3 id="one-command">One command</h3>
          <p>A command block can only execute a single command, but clever people on the internet have come up with ways to <a href="https://mrgarretto.com/cmdcombiner">translate a set of commands into a single (very long) command</a> which, when executed, creates a structure including multiple command blocks thereby allowing execution of all the commands.</p>
          <p>Ben suggested that this is analogous to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)">macro</a> expansion. These macro command blocks are commonly called “One Command” blocks and examples can be found <a href="http://onecmd.com/">all</a> <a href="https://minecraftcommand.science/commands">over</a> <a href="https://mrgarretto.com/allcmds">the interwebs</a>. You can see an example of such a block in action in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHumMbexjAs">this video</a>.</p>
          <h3 id="realms">Realms</h3>
          <p>Ben also told us that Microsoft are now offering <a href="https://minecraft.net/en/realms/">Minecraft realms</a>. This makes it easier to setup a multi-player version of the game to play with your friends.</p>
          <h2 id="scratch">Scratch</h2>
          <p>Lastly Ben showed us a selection of games which he and his son had built using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> - fun and inventive!</p>
          <h2 id="indieweb">IndieWeb</h2>
          <p>I talked a bit about how I was gradually getting sucked into using Facebook, but that I found the closed nature of the system very depressing. I’d done a bit of investigation into ways I could publish content on my own site and have notifications show up in Facebook, Twitter, etc. I’d come across <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> - “Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere”, which seemed to fit the bill for sending notifications.</p>
          <p>However, I was also wondering whether anyone knew of an easy way to restrict access to the content on my site to specific users (e.g. my Facebook friends). We thought I might just be able to use <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web">Facebook Login</a>. More investigation required!</p>
          <p>Anyway, that’s all for now. For those who attended, please feel free to improve <a href="https://github.com/freerange/site/blob/master/soups/blog/show-and-tell-20.snip.markdown">this write-up</a> via a <a href="https://github.com/freerange/site/pulls">pull request</a>. Apologies if I got anything wrong!</p>
          <p>Until next time,</p>
          <p>– James.</p>

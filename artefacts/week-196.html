          <h2 id="govuk">GOV.UK</h2>
          <p>This week we’ve been back at Aviation House continuing work on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government">Inside Government</a> with our <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">GDS</a> colleagues. The big news of the week was <a href="https://www.gov.uk">gov.uk</a> coming <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/static/pull/94">out of beta</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/attentiondeficit/8096118843/in/photostream/">replacing DirectGov</a> and Business Link. The release seemed to go very smoothly and the site is happily handling more than a million hits a day on its new G-Cloud-sourced <a href="http://skyscapecloud.com">Skyscape</a> infrastructure.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk"><img src="/images/blog/govuk.png" style="width: 100%"></a></p>
          <p>While our GDS colleagues on other teams should take most of the credit, the Inside Government team was responsible for delivering the longer-form <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/10/09/not-so-special-after-all/">detailed guidance</a> pages. So whether you’re concerned about exporting stuff that <a href="https://www.gov.uk/weapons-of-mass-destruction-wmd-end-use-control">might be used to build WMD</a>, wondering how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/sheep-and-goat-welfare">look after your goats</a>, or contemplating <a href="https://www.gov.uk/high-speed-craft-construction-and-maintenance-standards">building a high-speed passenger ferry</a>, we have the answers.</p>
          <p><img src="/images/blog/gov-uk-detailed-guidance-weapons-of-mass-destruction-end-use-control.png" style="width: 100%"></p>
          <p>When you’ve got your head down on a project like Inside Government, it’s easy to forget about the bigger picture. So it was good to understand a bit more about <em><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/oct/17/gov-uk-website-internet">why this new government website really matters</a></em>.</p>
          <h2 id="harmonia">Harmonia</h2>
          <p>Although it was good to get stuck back in to work on Inside Government, this week was also a reminder of how hard it is to make progress on GFR projects at the same time as working on a client project. This was particularly noticeable, because we were one man short this week with <a href="/james-adam">James A</a> on holiday. This meant that for more than half the week there was <em>at most</em> one of us on GFR duty. I know that I for one find it more difficult to make progress on this shared undertaking when none of the others are around.</p>
          <p>Consequently we haven’t made as much progress on <a href="https://harmonia.io">Harmonia</a> as I would’ve liked. Perhaps it was just the contrast between this week and last week, but it feels as if a lot of the momentum we built up last week has disappeared.</p>
          <p>Having said that, <a href="/chris-roos">Chris</a> seems to have made good progress on building a mechanism for sending out invitations. As explained by James in <a href="/week-193">week #193</a> we’ve decided to roll our own authentication-related code rather than use a 3rd party library. It feels to me as if we’ve invested quite a bit of time working on such functionality (e.g. sign-up, password reset, invitations, etc), but hopefully this will pay off later or when we come to work on other projects.</p>
          <h2 id="printer">Printer</h2>
          <p>There’s been continued interest in the <a href="/hello-printer">Go Free Range Printer</a> with News International (!) building <a href="https://github.com/newsinternational/printer-twilio">an SMS gateway for the printer</a> - you can send text messages and have them printed out on a little printer. And I belatedly caught up with <a href="http://finalbullet.com/printerletters.html">Elspeth and Lottie’s correspondence</a> which apparently…</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>…could never have been shared without the generosity of our benefactor philanthropist <a href="/james-adam">Mister James Adam</a> and his marvellous <a href="/">Go Free Range</a> contraptions”.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2 id="and-finally">And finally</h2>
          <p>We’re back up to full strength next week, so hopefully we’ll be able to get a first release of <a href="https://harmonia.io">Harmonia</a> out the door. I’m looking forward to seeing what people think about it and whether they find it useful.</p>

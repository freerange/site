          <p>Why, hello there. I hope you’re all very well.</p>
          <p>GFR were down to three this week as <a href="/james-mead">James M</a> is taking a well deserved holiday. We weren’t lonely in the office though: We’ve been hosting a couple of special guests all week (more on this shortly) and <a href="https://twitter.com/tomstuart">Tom Stuart</a> joined us for the first part of the week too. If you haven’t already, you should check out <a href="http://codon.com/building-a-govuk-exhibit">Tom’s explanation</a> of the work he did to help demo <a href="https://gov.uk">gov.uk</a> at the <a href="http://designmuseum.org/">Design Museum’s</a> <a href="http://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/2013/designs-of-the-year-2013">Designs of the year 2013</a> exhibition.</p>
          <h2 id="printers--prototypes">Printers & prototypes</h2>
          <p><a href="/james-adam">James A</a>’s managed to cram quite a lot in during this week. Not only has he sent <a href="/printer">printers</a> to the UK, the Netherlands and ‘stralia but he’s been busy getting everything in order for us to be able to send more at the drop of a hat. He’s also been experimenting with printing on labels, you know, if that’s your thing.</p>
          <p><em>Remember</em> If you’re interested in getting your hands on one of these splendid little kits, head over to our <a href="http://exciting.io/printer">printer kit page</a> and get your Paypal on.</p>
          <p>While not spending time with Printer, James has been busy polishing up <a href="/heylist">heylist</a>. He’s taken our original proof of concept script and turned it into an actual thing that makes it easy for anyone to build a twitter list of conference goers. We’re not quite ready to take the covers off completely yet but you’ll be the first to know as soon as we are.</p>
          <h2 id="project-los-roques">Project Los Roques</h2>
          <p>This is all well and good, I hear you say, but what’s the deal with the special guests, and what on earth have you and <a href="/tom-ward">Tom</a> been doing all week!? Alright, alright, I’ll tell you. Tom and I have spent the week working with a couple of people (M & J) that came to us with an idea but no money. It’s a bit of an experiment really, and we don’t know what will come of it but we’ve enjoyed the week and produced something that should allow M & J to take the concept further. I know this is all a bit secretive but you’ll have to trust me when I say that we will go into more detail soon; probably early week when we’ve had some time to reflect.</p>
          <p>And with that, I bid you all adieu and wish you all the very best of weekends.</p>

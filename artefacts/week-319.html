          <h1 id="week-319">Week 319</h1>
          <p>At the beginning of the week we were both decompressing a bit and catching up with admin. We both had a few bits of work-in-progress left over from FutureLearn and so we spent an hour or two sculpting it all into pull requests, gists and emails.</p>
          <p>I then made a start on writing up the <a href="/week-318">week notes</a>, but got side-tracked into moving one of our internal wiki pages <a href="/checking-our-annual-accounts">onto our public site</a>. The CSS on our site is a bit unloved, so this took a bit longer than I intended. However, we are planning to publish as much of our internal wiki as we sensibly can - we’d like to be as open as possible about how our company works.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile <a href="/chris-roos">Chris</a> made a start on our weekly book-keeping task. This was trickier than usual, because we needed to explain the <em>partial</em> return of the deposit relating to our old Worship Street office, but I think we mostly understand what we need to do.</p>
          <h2 id="nand2tetris">Nand2Tetris</h2>
          <p>On Tuesday evening, I went to a <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2015/london-computation-club-nand2tetris-meeting-6/">meeting of the London Computation Club</a> in which we successfully implemented an assembler for the Hack assembly language. This generates machine code to run on the Hack hardware platform that we “wired up” in the previous meeting.</p>
          <p>We’ve taken to working through the exercises as a group on the projector with one person driving. This seems to work much better when we use a test-driven approach, because it helps keep us all focussed on the same thing.</p>
          <h2 id="office-hunt">Office Hunt</h2>
          <p>We were out and about for all of Wednesday, meeting potential clients and viewing possible desk/office space. After a meeting, we had a quick look around <a href="http://www.theofficegroup.co.uk/">The Office Group</a> in Marylebone and then headed to the <a href="http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/stpancras/#cafe">café at the British Library</a> for lunch and a bit of a chat about our plans for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>We then dropped into the <a href="http://kingscross.impacthub.net/">Kings Cross Impact Hub</a> and the <a href="http://islington.impacthub.net/">Islington Impact Hub</a> as we made our way eastwards towards Shoreditch. We hadn’t appreciated that both these places are run as franchises and so there’s a really different feel to each one. Lee, the Community Host at the Islington one, was particularly welcoming, especially given we’d just turned up on spec.</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.techspace.london/">Techspace</a> and <a href="http://london.techhub.com/">TechHub</a> were right at the other end of the spectrum. Techspace doesn’t have anyone on-site to chat to drop-ins (at least not in their Bath St office). And even though TechHub (Old St) has a staffed reception, you need to make an appointment to view the office and even then you have to prove you are a company developing a “product”. It’s probably silly of me, but the formality of both organisations really put me off.</p>
          <p>We then ended up at Google’s <a href="https://www.campuslondon.com/">Campus London</a> for a well-earned cup of tea, although we had to slum it on one of the picnic tables in the courtyard which got a bit chilly after a while - apparently the desks here fill up soon after 9am when it opens. Chris booked us in for a few more viewings while I interjected with unhelpful comments from the sidelines.</p>
          <h2 id="beer">Beer</h2>
          <p>After an early & delicious dinner at the <a href="http://www.wearetbc.com/">Book Club</a>, we headed to the <a href="http://wenlockarms.com/">Wenlock Arms</a> for our monthly drinks. It was our first visit to this pub, but it turns out that it has a fine array of cask ales. <a href="http://darkstarbrewing.co.uk/">Dark Star</a>’s Hophead and American Pale Ale were popular choices and <a href="http://www.camdentownbrewery.com/hells-lager/">Camden Hells Lager</a> kept Chris R happy. Anyway, a good time was had by all, although apparently there were a few sore heads the next morning.</p>
          <h2 id="more-viewings">More Viewings</h2>
          <p>On Thursday morning, Chris and I were up relatively early to visit <a href="http://www.sidekickstudios.net/">Sidekick Studios</a> where there were a couple of desks available to rent - they have a very nice space on City Road just north of the Old Street roundabout. We went straight on from there to a viewing at the smart-looking <a href="http://centralworking.com/">Central Working</a> offices next door to Campus London. They offer everything from co-working to serviced offices and it was good to get a feel for the prices of all these different options.</p>
          <p>We poked our noses into Campus London & the <a href="http://www.dolcezza.co.uk/">Dolcezza Café</a>, but they were both full, so we headed to <a href="http://www.lantanacafe.co.uk/">Lantana Café</a> on City Road and discussed our options over a tasty brunch. After a brief pitstop in <a href="https://thehoxton.com/">The Hoxton</a>, we walked up to Hoxton Square for a speculative look at Shoreditch Works’ <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/179276400/open-the-shoreditch-village-hall">Shoreditch Village Hall</a>. Unfortunately it turned out not to exist any more - it’s a complete building site. We subsequently discovered that Aviva attended a hack day there and liked it so much they bought the building!</p>
          <h2 id="fun-times">Fun Times</h2>
          <h3 id="money-tracker">Money Tracker</h3>
          <p>At this point, we parted company and worked at home for the rest of the day. We decided to give ourselves the rest of the week to work on fun projects.</p>
          <p>Chris got back his head back into <a href="https://github.com/chrisroos/money-tracker">Money Tracker</a> by upgrading to the latest versions of Ruby & of Rails and by merging a couple of my 10-month-old <a href="https://github.com/chrisroos/money-tracker/pull/9">pull</a> <a href="https://github.com/chrisroos/money-tracker/pull/10">requests</a>. Yay! His main motivation is that he wants to get a better understanding of where all his money goes. I’m looking forward to seeing where he goes with it.</p>
          <h3 id="software-defined-radio">Software-defined Radio</h3>
          <p>A couple of months back, I mentioned that I’m interested in <a href="/week-310-links#rtl-sdrhttpwwwrtl-sdrcomabout-rtl-sdr">building a cheap AIS receiver using a DVB-T TV tuner dongle</a>. Soon after that I managed to cobble together a flakey build of the <a href="http://sdrsharp.com/#download">SDR#</a> software on my Mac using <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a>! However, since then I’ve done a clean install of OS X Yosemite and lost track of what I’d done, so I decided to start afresh.</p>
          <p>I discovered a <a href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/big-list-rtl-sdr-supported-software/">few more software options</a> and decided to give <a href="http://gqrx.dk/">GQRX</a> a go. After a lot of faffing about, I managed to <a href="https://gist.github.com/floehopper/d5d4ee1d15fc0b7bb128">build it successfully</a>. In my previous experiments with SDR# I hadn’t managed to receive anything that looked like an AIS signal. I’d put this down to a combination of not fully understanding all the SDR settings, not having a suitable aerial and not being in line-of-sight of any ships.</p>
          <p>Chris sensibly suggested that I try to receive a more well-known/stronger signal to check the hardware & software was working. After a lot of fiddling with the receiver settings, I eventually managed to tune in to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1">BBC Radio 1</a>…</p>
          <p><img alt="Screenshot of GQRX tuned to BBC Radio 1" src="/images/blog/2015-02-27-gqrx-bbc-radio-1.png" style="width: 100%"></p>
          <p>The audio quality was pretty decent, although the level on this recording is a bit on the low side…</p>
          <p><audio controls="" src="/assets/blog/2015-02-27-gqrx-bbc-radio-1.m4a">Your browser does not support audio.</audio></p>
          <p>Anyway, until next time.</p>
          <p>– James</p>

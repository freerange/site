          <p>Go Free Range is a member of the <a href="https://www.coops.tech/">CoTech</a> network of cooperatives. One of the aims of the network is to foster cooperation among its members and in doing so embody the 6th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles#Cooperation_among_cooperatives">“Rochdale Principle”</a>.</p>
          <p>We recently attended <a href="https://2017.open.coop/">Open 2017</a> and had chance to meet with Felix Weth from <a href="https://www.fairmondo.de/">Fairmondo Germany</a> and Jack and Bob Thorpe from <a href="https://fairmondo.uk/">Fairmondo UK</a>. Fairmondo is a successful, ethically run marketplace for sellers in Germany and Fairmondo UK are replicating that model for sellers in the UK.</p>
          <p>Fairmondo UK is currently based on the <a href="https://github.com/sharetribe/sharetribe">Sharetribe</a> open-source marketplace software but they have some ideas of how to improve their marketplace that are difficult to achieve with Sharetribe out-of-the-box.</p>
          <p>Fairmondo UK wondered if it would be possible to extend the Sharetribe code with the features they need or whether they would be better served by adopting the <a href="https://github.com/fairmondo/fairmondo">Fairmondo Germany code</a> to power their marketplace. As both applications are written in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> - a technology we have a lot of experience of here at Go Free Range - we offered to help Fairmondo UK by taking a look at both applications and giving them some advice.</p>
          <p>We also took a step back to consider what Fairmondo UK were trying to achieve and whether there would be some alternatives that they hadn’t considered.</p>
          <p>We can’t talk too much at this stage about what we recommended, as Fairmondo UK are thinking about their next steps - but they were very pleased with the advice we gave them. We also learnt a lot by looking at a couple of different, large Rails apps including how <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html">translation and internationalisation</a> works in Rails.</p>

          <p>If a blog post is published to the internet and Google Reader isn’t around to show it, will it ever be read? I guess that’s something we’ll all soon find out.</p>
          <p>When to stop offering things you’ve offered before is one of the things we talked about on Wednesday. As you may know, we’ve been selling ready-made versions of our <a href="/printer">printer</a>. On Wednesday we stopped. Not because we no longer want people to use printer - we’d love it if more people did, and <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer/wiki/Making-your-own-printer">following these detailed instructions they still can</a>. Nor are we giving up on it - there’s something interesting there we want to find. However, building these kits ourselves no longer feels like the best way to discover it. Besides, with James A moving to Austin (more of which below), the quality of the printers would surely go down. A solderer I am not.</p>
          <h2 id="james-moves-to-austin">James moves to Austin</h2>
          <p>As I mentioned last week and above, James A is moving to Austin and this was his last week in the office. On Wednesday evening we all headed down to <a href="http://dovepubs.com/aboutdovetail/">the dovetail</a> to toast him on his way, joined many of his and GFR’s friends, and even my <a href="https://twitter.com/tomafro/status/349921159313244161/photo/1">new son</a>. There was a lot of warmth and friendship in the room - it’s clear GFR won’t be the only people to miss his presence in London. Not surprising when you consider the work he’s put into printer, Ruby Manor and much much more. I hope he still considers himself a London developer in exile, rather than a permanent Austinite.</p>
          <h2 id="any-other-business">Any other business</h2>
          <p>Finally, the bulk of our week has been spent once more working on FutureLearn. We’ve reached the end of the MVP build (though I see in Pivotal there are still a couple of stories above the MVP milestone). This means we can very soon expect real live users (and not a moment too soon)! Real educators will be writing courses, and real learners will be taking them. For now, only a select few specially chosen friends will be invited, but even with such a limited audience we can expect to learn loads. I for one can’t wait.</p>
          <p>Until next time,</p>
          <p>Tom</p>

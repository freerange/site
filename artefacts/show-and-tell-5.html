          <p>We hosted our fifth Show and Tell on Wednesday last week. There were nine of us involved and four of us demonstrated something we’d been doing.</p>
          <p><a href="/james-mead">James</a> and I kicked off proceedings by showing the work we’ve been doing on the video project. We talked about how we might be able to make it a little different and solicited feedback on whether there were any obvious flaws in our plans.</p>
          <p>We also chatted briefly about the 3D printer that we’re borrowing from <a href="http://mymakie.com/">Makie</a>. We showed the <a href="/week-292#the-finished-article">bracelet we’d printed</a> and asked if anyone had ideas for what they’d like to print. <a href="http://symphonicknot.com/">Nicky</a> wondered if we could print something similar to these <a href="http://www.unitednude.com/news/2014/united-nude-3d-printing-52">United Nude shoes</a> and, in doing so, volunteered to arrange a date to get some people together to give it a go.</p>
          <p>Nicky continued the evening by demonstrating <a href="http://uneditions.com/the-noise/">The Noise</a>, a project she’d worked on with <a href="http://storythings.com/">Storythings</a> among others. The Noise uses the <a href="http://uneditions.com/">UNEDITIONS</a> digital publishing platform to present theatre performances in new ways. This prompted James to mention <a href="https://twitter.com/beng">Ben</a>’s work on <a href="http://sh.akespeare.com/">Readable Shakespeare Plays</a> and reminded me of the alternative reading experience provided by <a href="http://www.thebellman.ca/">The Bellman</a>.</p>
          <p>Frustrated by losing all his data when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Health">Google Health</a> was retired, <a href="http://ryansnyder.me/">Ryan</a> talked about using <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> to backup his data from multiple services to Google Drive. Ryan recognises the potential problem of relying on Google Drive but figures that it’s a good first step to get all his data in one place, and a step on the road to eventually syndicating his data using <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">POSSE</a>. I’ve started doing something similar, albeit manually, by creating recurring tasks that prompt me to download data I don’t want to lose.</p>
          <p><a href="http://po-ru.com/">Paul</a> talked about generalising the problem of processing a number of source input files to generate some other number of output files (think static site generation). There was some discussion that went over my head as to whether <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a> might be suitable, but it sounded like that wasn’t quite general enough. Maybe we’ll be able to see where Paul’s got to at the next Show and Tell.</p>
          <p>We finished up in the office by around 20:30 and retreated to the Old King’s Head to continue the conversations.</p>

          <p>If this sounds like the sort of thing you’re interested in, then please do <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>. We’re keen to keep these fairly small but would also like them to be open to other people.</p>

          <p>Although not technically part of the Show and Tell, <a href="http://h-lame.com/">Murray</a> was keen to show quite how neat he can be when eating Pistachio nuts. Good job, Murray :-)</p>

          <h1 id="week-353">Week 353</h1>
          <p>We reduced our time on <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers">Smart Answers</a> this week and did a 3:2 split of days, spending Monday & Tuesday at Aviation House and the rest of the week at GFRHQ.</p>
          <h2 id="smart-answers">Smart Answers</h2>
          <h3 id="business-as-usual">Business as usual</h3>
          <p>With Erik now on the case, we had less of this to contend with. However, we continued to work on some in-progress items where it made sense, e.g. because we had more history/context:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Chris got the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/pull/2012">landlord-immigration-check updated and published</a>. This (originally Smartdown) flow has been in draft status and awaiting fact-checking since we started work on the project early this year, so it was great to finally get it published.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>I spent a lot of time continuing to work on fixing a bug in calculate-statuatory-sick-pay. I thought I’d finally cracked it and submitted <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/pull/2031">a new pull request explaining the changes in detail</a>, but having conferred with our contact at HMRC it turned out that I hadn’t correctly understood the rules, so there’s still more work to do on this.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="converting-smartdown-flows">Converting Smartdown flows</h3>
          <p>Chris continued on his quest to banish Smartdown from the app. First of all he got the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/pull/2018">renaming of pay-leave-for-parents question pages</a> which he’d worked on in the previous week merged.</p>
          <p>Then, since we’ve stopped using multiple questions per page, he <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/pull/2029">removed the ability to display question page titles</a> from the code. These were no longer adding much/any value. This change will also mean when pay-leave-for-parents is converted from Smartdown to Ruby Smart Ansers, the regression test artefacts will be easier to compare.</p>
          <h3 id="fail-fast">Fail fast</h3>
          <p>Unfortunately, there are a lot of places in the app which swallow exceptions and/or silently fallback to (often unhelpful/surprising) default values. We’ve been gradually trying to remove these. Last week I did some <a href="/week-352#question-options">work on this around question options</a>, but some exceptions occurred in production over the weekend highlighting <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/pull/2020">some question option translations which I’d missed</a>.</p>
          <p>Chris ran into a problem where the very generic <code>ArgumentError</code> was being rescued around big blocks of code. He changed the code so it <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/pull/2032">rescued the generic exception much closer to its source and raised a much more specific application-specific exception instead</a>.</p>
          <h3 id="tidying-up">Tidying up</h3>
          <p>In preparation for splitting the question content up from the flow-wide i18n file into question-specific files, I <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/pull/2023">moved outcome templates into their own sub-directory</a>.</p>
          <p>The <code>Services</code> module was added relatively recently in <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/commit/34f8f7f4b169c8f10471edc630c7c1088cc205aa">this commit</a>. It introduced a <em>different</em> way to “lookup” clients to external APIs. I wasn’t sure whether this was the official GDS way, but I wanted to <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/pull/2025">make the code more consistent</a> by doing this kind of thing only one way.</p>
          <h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
          <p>We continued to add/improve the documentation:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/pull/2007">Add docs for CI and deploying to preview</a> (implemented last week; now merged)
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/pull/2021">Bring docs into line with most recent practice</a> (tweaks to release note format)
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/pull/2024">Improve documentation for regression tests</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="gfr">GFR</h2>
          <p>On Wednesday Chris took the afternoon off to attend Amy’s UK citizenship ceremony - congratulations Amy!</p>
          <p>On Thursday we both did a half-day on Smart Answers, me, mainly because I needed to respond to our contact at HMRC, and Chris, because he’d taken a half-day the day before.</p>
          <p>The rest of Thursday and the beginning of Friday was spent doing company admin. I sorted out the payment of our Corporation Tax (take note Google, Amazon, Startbucks, et al!) and picked a pub for our monthly drinks. Amongst other things, Chris did some research into whether his pension qualifies for auto-enrolment, and identifyied items in our lock-up which we might want to sell or give away.</p>
          <h2 id="music-library">Music Library</h2>
          <p>On Friday, we spent much of the day working on the Music Library project in collaboration with <a href="http://hookline.tv/">Hookline</a>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Amy shared a Trello board with us and I added all the physical cards from our whiteboard.</li>
            <li>I added time-limited URLs for the tracks and artwork to the CSV export.</li>
            <li>Chris made the playlist download links work correctly in Safari.</li>
            <li>I tweaked the application config to force the use of SSL.</li>
            <li>I setup daily and (hopefully) weekly database backups on Heroku.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Anyway, that’s all for now. Until next time.</p>
          <p>– James</p>

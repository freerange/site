          <h3 id="mondohttpgetmondocouk"><a href="http://getmondo.co.uk/">Mondo</a></h3>
          <p>Last year when we were working on our <a href="/credit-union">Credit Union project</a>, we met up with Tom Blomfield to chat about what he was doing at Bank Possible (which is now called <a href="https://starlingbank.co.uk/">Starling</a>). It turns out that he’s now <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/24/mondo/">left Starling and has started his own mobile-first bank</a>, Mondo.</p>
          <p>I also recently came across <a href="http://www.monese.com/">Monese</a> which seems to be offering something similar. It certainly seems as if there’s loads of activity in this sector. I can’t wait for some better offerings to appear - they’re long overdue. <em>— <a href="/james-mead">JM</a></em></p>
          <h3 id="microservice-premiumhttpmartinfowlercomblikimicroservicepremiumhtml"><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePremium.html">Microservice Premium</a></h3>
          <p>In this article Martin Fowler says:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>My primary guideline would be <strong>don’t even consider microservices unless you have a system that’s too complex to manage as a monolith</strong>. The majority of software systems should be built as a single monolithic application. Do pay attention to good modularity within that monolith, but don’t try to separate it into separate services.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Apparently microservices are the new hotness. So-called “monolithic” applications are not. It’s unfortunate that the word “monolithic” is used so pejoratively. The development and operational costs of building an application as a set of microservices are often massively under-estimated. <em>— <a href="/james-mead">JM</a></em></p>
          <h3 id="inbox-sdkhttpswwwinboxsdkcom"><a href="https://www.inboxsdk.com/">Inbox SDK</a></h3>
          <p>This is supposedly a high-level JavaScript library with which you can build browser extensions to interact with your Gmail account. It seems to have been extracted from <a href="https://www.streak.com/">Streak CRM</a> and as far as I can see <a href="https://www.inboxsdk.com/terms">it’s free</a> to use, although not open-source. Chris & I often talk about automating the handling of company-related emails and I thought this might be worth a try. <em>— <a href="/james-mead">JM</a></em></p>

          <p>A while ago Chris talked about moving his blog from <a href="http://webby.rubyforge.org/">Webby</a> to a standard Rails app. He thought that by taking full advantage of HTTP caching he’d be able to achieve similar performance to that of a static website. This article reminded me of that conversation. <em>— <a href="/james-mead">JM</a></em></p>

          <p>This is like <a href="http://timehop.com/">Timehop</a>, but for GitHub. It reminded me of an idea Chris had recently - showing you your own commit messages some time after you made them to see whether you can still understand what you meant. <em>— <a href="/james-mead">JM</a></em></p>

          <p>Google have developed a Postcode-like system for the entire world! Seeing this reminded me of <a href="https://tomafro.net/">Tom</a>’s little <a href="https://github.com/tomafro/geohash-explorer">geohash exploring utility</a> that he <a href="https://tomafro.net/2011/09/a-small-toy-to-explore-geohashes">wrote about</a> back in September 2011! It turns out that there are a number of alternative location encoding systems, including Geohash, and the <a href="https://github.com/google/open-location-code">open-location-code repository</a> contains an interesting <a href="https://github.com/google/open-location-code/blob/master/docs/comparison.adoc">comparison</a> that helps explain the motivation for yet another system. <em>— <a href="/chris-roos">CR</a></em></p>

          <p>This is great! A completely automated approach for generating time-lapse movies from large numbers of public images available on the web. <em>— <a href="/chris-roos">CR</a></em></p>

          <p>It’s great to see FutureLearn start to open up some of their course content to people that aren’t registered on the course. I know they’ve been wanting to do it for quite some time so it’s great to see them making progress in this direction. <em>— <a href="/chris-roos">CR</a></em></p>

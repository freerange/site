          <h1 id="week-318">Week 318</h1>
          <p>We started the week with a couple of days to ourselves – we caught up with a lot of admin on Monday and then met up with a few people on Tuesday. And we spent Wednesday, Thursday & Friday at <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn</a>.</p>
          <h2 id="accountancy">Accountancy</h2>
          <p>On Monday we made the decision to stop using an accountant for our statutory annual accounts and corporation tax return. All <a href="/people">members of GFR</a> take it in turns to keep on top of the book-keeping using <a href="http://www.freeagent.com/">FreeAgent</a>’s excellent system and we’ve always been at pains to <a href="/checking-our-annual-accounts">understand as much as possible of what our accountant does</a>. So we’re hoping that we can get by without help from an accountant using the standard HRMC tools. This may turn out to be a foolhardy decision, but we’re going to give it a go.</p>
          <h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>
          <p>We met up with our old friends, <a href="https://twitter.com/neillyneil">Neil Williams</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bradwright/">Brad Wright</a>, at GDS on Tuesday morning. It was good to hear what they’re up to and what the future holds for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>, etc.</p>
          <p>We then wandered down to <a href="http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/">Somerset House</a> and chatted in the sun over a coffee on the terrace. We then tried to do some work, but struggled to get a decent internet connection, so we popped inside to grab some lunch from <a href="http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/plan-your-visit/eating-and-drinking/toms-deli">Tom’s Deli</a> and found ourselves a comfy sofa to work at.</p>
          <p>After lunch we wandered up to <a href="http://www.workshopcoffee.com/pages/clerkenwell-cafe">Workshop Coffee in Clerkenwell</a> to meet <a href="http://www.alliants.com/team/lee-jon-ball/">LJ from Alliants</a>. It was interesting to compare notes on the history of our respective companies and on the trials and tribulations of finding office space in London. I was very jealous to hear that <a href="http://www.alliants.com/blog/latest/2013/11/11/new-office">their office is in a marina on the Hamble river</a> and they have a company yacht. I’m now busy trying to persuade <a href="/chris-roos">Chris</a> that we should get a company yacht instead of an office.</p>
          <h2 id="futurelearn">FutureLearn</h2>
          <p>This was our last week at FutureLearn. I mainly paired with <a href="https://github.com/alssndro">Alex</a> on a couple of stories. The first one was a pretty straightforward change to the logic which determines when to display links to buy things like a <a href="https://about.futurelearn.com/about/faq/?category=statements-of-participation">Statement of Participation</a>. Although the change was small, we found the existing code and specs rather confusing, so we spent a while trying to improve them before making our change.</p>
          <p>The second story was about notifying learners by email when they become eligible for a Statement of Participation. First we came up with a <a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-rails/#Feature_Specs">feature spec</a> for the most obvious scenario and then worked down the stack writing a controller spec and a mailer spec as we went until we got the feature spec passing.</p>
          <p>Having chatted to others on the team, we realised there was another scenario which we’d missed, so we added a new scenario to the feature spec and got that passing in a similar way. We then extracted most of the logic out into a service object to remove most of the duplication which was a satisfying way to round off my time at FutureLearn.</p>
          <p>As well as doing some pairing with <a href="http://www.markjs.net/">Mark</a>, Chris did some investigation into the efficiency of the code used to keep two <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS S3</a> buckets in sync. Over time these buckets have filled up with a lot of data and the overnight syncing process had started taking hours.</p>
          <p>So Chris did some experiments and discovered that using the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/">AWS SDK</a> was significantly faster than the existing implementation which used <a href="http://fog.io/">Fog</a>. It turned out that using the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS Command Line Interface</a> was even faster.</p>
          <p>After work we said our goodbyes to the FutureLearn team over some beverages at the <a href="http://www.parcelyard.co.uk/">Parcel Yard</a>. We’ve loved working with them and wish them all the best for the future.</p>
          <p>Anyway, onward and upward!</p>
          <p>– James</p>

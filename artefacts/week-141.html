          <p>Big news this week: we now have an office. It’s been a (very) long process, but on Thursday we finally signed a lease on some space in Worship Street. It’s great to have a new home. We’ll be sure to invite you all around when we move in.</p>
          <p>I say when, because at the moment we’re all working with the Gov UK team in Lambeth. Our new office may lie empty for a while.</p>
          <p>It was my first week working with the team, and I’m really impressed with how much has been achieved. We’ve built a small platform to publish various bits of government information, with a simple workflow and fact-checking facilities baked right in. In the next sprint we’ll build on this, adding more knowledge about the structure of government. That’s when things become really interesting. Remember, you can <a href="http://github.com/alphagov/whitehall">follow along at home</a>.</p>
          <p>One advantage of being based in Lambeth is that we get to watch the other Gov UK team members at work. The whole office has a real buzz; a feeling that everyone’s contributing to something significant.</p>

          <p>While most of us have been toiling in Lambeth, <a href="/jason-cale">Jason</a> took his trip to Sofia to speak at <a href="http://designday.netmag.bg/">DesignDay 2011</a>. His talk went well, but his attempts to follow a vegan diet faltered.</p>
          <h3 id="miscellany">Miscellany</h3>
          <p>Other bits and pieces include the fact that <a href="/james-adam">James Adam</a> is making one of his regular visits to Austin, Texas. He’ll be working whilst away; our challenge is to keep working as a team despite the time-zone mismatch. We’re not great at it yet, but we’re determined to get better.</p>
          <p>Finally, I and other members of the team are busy working on our <a href="http://lrug.org/">LRUG</a> Battleship programs. If you want to challenge us, there’s about a week left to write yourself a player. You’d better hope that <a href="http://po-ru.com/">Paul</a> has implemented some strict security counter measures, because like all good Generals, I intend to cheat. Remember, all’s fair in love and war.</p>

    <title>Week 482</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="week-482"&gt;Week 482&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hello! This week we moved into our new office, Ben had his first full week as a Go Free Range member and we took some time to learn and work on a side project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="new-office"&gt;New Office&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We recently took a 4-person office in a &lt;a href="https://www.ministryofstartups.com/"&gt;Ministry of Startups&lt;/a&gt;-run building on Turner Street in Whitechapel. We’d being paying £375/month for our co-working desks at The Office Group and while having access to their very well maintained buildings across London was a definite plus, the costs started to add up when we considered having a fourth membership. Ministry of Startups say:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re real, We’re honest, We’re not perfect. (But we definitely know what startups actually need from a coworking space)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our 4-person office is partitioned from a larger open warehouse-like space on the top floor of a building. We have great natural light and views over the city, solid desks, access to a small kitchen, a quiet working environment and fast, reliable wifi. We’ve been here every day this week so far, and are happy with the £225/desk/month price.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This seems like a good base for now while we consider looking for something more conveniently located for all of us. If you happen to be in the Whitechapel Area, get in touch and pop by for a cuppa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="welcome-ben"&gt;Welcome Ben&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ben had his first day with us in the office on Monday and during the week we have been getting him set up with accounts on the various systems we use (Trello, Harmonia, Google, Heroku, AWS etc.). We also added him to our online banking and made sure he was included in our payroll and auto-enrolment pension contributions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I joined GFR this time last year it had been quite a long time since anyone had joined and we took the opportunity to document some of the things we needed to do. I think that documentation came in handy this time but there’s still a lot of manual work to be done - and frustratingly, paper forms to print and send by post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s great to have Ben in the team and when the &lt;a href="https://harmonia.io/"&gt;Harmonia&lt;/a&gt; gods smile upon him you’ll hear from him in our weeknotes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="voice-controlled-devices"&gt;Voice-controlled devices&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re between client projects this week so we thought we’d take some time out to learn about voice-controlled “virtual assistants”. These services, for example Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s Assistant are accessed via smartphone or desktop applications, or through dedicated hardware such as the Alexa or Google Home. We have a few of these types of devices to hand and thought it would be fun to play around with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The task we set ourselves at the beginning of the week was to see if we could port an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine"&gt;Infocom-style text adventure game&lt;/a&gt; to a voice-controlled assistant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We started by surveying some of the technology that is available. I read through the &lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit"&gt;documentation and tutorials&lt;/a&gt; for the Alexa system, while Chris spent some time looking at the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/actions/"&gt;Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile Ben investigated &lt;a href="https://dialogflow.com/"&gt;Dialogflow&lt;/a&gt;, an abstraction service that allows applications to be deployed to multiple assistant platforms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to learn a bit more about the technology we decided to build a simple application first. At Go Free Range we often assign card on our trello board to one of us at random. We thought we’d build a voice-controlled application to do this. By Wednesday we had something working on Google Assistant and Alexa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developing an Alexa application, or “skill” involves two phases. Firstly the skill is registered in the Alexa developer console. Here we choose a name, define a series of commands (known as “intents”) and provide some sample phrases to trigger those intents. For an example, a conversation with our Go Free Range Helper skill might go like:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &amp;gt; Me: Alexa, ask the Go Free Range Helper to choose someone &amp;gt; Alexa: Chris L is the chosen one &amp;gt; Me: Choose someone else &amp;gt; Alexa: Ben is the chosen one &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;The command to “choose someone” results in some JSON like&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; 'request': { 'locale': 'en-US', 'type': 'IntentRequest', 'intent': { 'name': 'assignment' } } &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;being sent to a application that can be accessed at an end point defined in the skill configuration. The application responds with the text to be spoken which is then read out by Alexa. Amazon suggest to use their “serverless” &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"&gt;Lambda&lt;/a&gt; platform to run the application, but it is also possible to use any application accessible over HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We wrote a &lt;a href="https://github.com/freerange/alexa-helper"&gt;simple nodejs application&lt;/a&gt; to handle the logic of the application. We also spent some time learning how to deploy Lambda applications using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/serverless/serverless"&gt;Serverless Framework&lt;/a&gt; and test it using &lt;a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/"&gt;Jest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris R also implemented the same application for the Google Assistant platform using &lt;a href="https://dialogflow.com/"&gt;Dialogflow&lt;/a&gt; to write and deploy the application. Here’s a video of it being tested using the developer tools in Dialogflow:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;video width="600" height="400" controls=""&gt; &lt;source src="http://gofreerange.com/images/blog/gfr-assignomatic.mov" type="video/quicktime" /&gt; &lt;source src="http://gofreerange.com/movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" /&gt; Your browser does not support the video tag. &lt;/video&gt; &lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the week, having got a grasp on the development process and terminology, we started to work on our more sophisticated application idea - porting a text adventure game to Alexa. Ben investigated several implementations of the “z-machine” interpreter that allows popular text adventure games to be run. He settled on &lt;a href="https://github.com/freerange/gruesome"&gt;this Ruby implementation&lt;/a&gt; and set about modifying it to work with our proposed architecture. This involved modifying the code to allow the state to be serialised and reloaded, which will allow our Alexa application to keep track of where a player is in the game. He also added a Sinatra-based API to the engine so that it could be played using HTTP.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I write, Chris is hooking up this game engine to a new Alexa Skill. If we decide to carry on with this side-project next week, we’ll have more to show you then.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until next time!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- add content here --&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="week-481"&gt;Week 481&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Afternoon folks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a beautiful day here today: it finally feels a bit like Spring after some very cold and wet days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/james-mead"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; rejoined us on Tuesday after his week away and after we’d all enjoyed the long Easter weekend break.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We spent Tuesday and Wednesday working on the GDS &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager"&gt;Asset Manager&lt;/a&gt; project before finally finishing up and handing over yesterday. I have slightly mixed feelings about handing it over: having a break from the work is very welcome but I’m disappointed that we didn’t get as much done as we’d have liked. Unfortunately the budget wouldn’t allow us to continue but I’m hopeful that we’ve done a good enough job of documenting what we’ve done so that the GOV.UK team can continue the work to get the remaining &lt;a href="http://github.com/alphagov/whitehall"&gt;Whitehall&lt;/a&gt; attachments served by Asset Manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our other big news of the week is that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/beng"&gt;Ben Griffiths&lt;/a&gt; has joined us as our newest member. James and I have both worked with Ben in the past (James and Ben at &lt;a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/"&gt;Thoughtworks&lt;/a&gt; and James, Ben and I at &lt;a href="https://www.reevoo.com/"&gt;Reevoo&lt;/a&gt;) and he’s been a friend of GFR since the beginning. Since leaving Reevoo Ben’s been involved in numerous startups and has most recently been working at &lt;a href="https://www.dxw.com/"&gt;DXW&lt;/a&gt;. We’re all really happy to have Ben join and are looking forward to seeing what this means for us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ben’s official start date is today but we’ve all agreed to take it a bit easier today and to welcome Ben properly on Monday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until next time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;– Chris&lt;/p&gt;</content>

A friend suggested we look at &lt;a href="http://www.ministryofstartups.com/"&gt;Ministry of Startups&lt;/a&gt;. We got in touch and were able to view a couple of their Whitechapel properties on Monday. The offices look just about perfect for what we’re after and they’re &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; competitively priced so we’re planning to take one on. We’ve notified TOG that we’d like to cancel our memberships.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re coming to the end of our time on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager"&gt;Asset Manager&lt;/a&gt; project and have a final handover session arranged for Thursday next week. We ran the metadata update in production earlier this week but then suffered a number of setbacks that have further delayed us being able to switch to serving &lt;a href="http://github.com/alphagov/whitehall"&gt;Whitehall&lt;/a&gt; attachments from Asset Manager. We’ll have to see how much we can do on Tuesday and Wednesday before the handover.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris published the &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/show-and-tell-42"&gt;write-up of our Show &amp;amp; Tell event from last week&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/week-479"&gt;weeknotes for last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris also helped get the &lt;a href="https://community.coops.tech/t/cotech-newsletter-march-2018/685"&gt;CoTech March newsletter&lt;/a&gt; published.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve ordered a laptop for our new member. He joins us on the 6th of April so we’ll be able to share who it is next week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harmonia chose me to donate to charity this month and I chose &lt;a href="https://www.nct.org.uk/"&gt;NCT&lt;/a&gt;. My partner and I are expecting our first child and have been making use of the great NCT classes available.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until next time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;– Chris&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="week-477"&gt;Week 477&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;I returned from an extended trip to Colombia this week and in my jet-lagged state never got round to writing weeknotes. These come to you, therefore, almost 3 weeks late!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking back through my notes I see we spent a couple of days in the Bloomsbury Office Group office, held our monthly drinks at The Three Crowns and continued to work on our Asset Manager project for GDS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="asset-manager"&gt;Asset Manager&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are trying to move the last remaining files (around 500,000 attachments) from the Whitehall publishing application to Asset Manager. In doing so we need to make sure that Whitehall no longer depends on files existing on the file system as once we’ve made the switch the files will leave in Amazon’s cloud storage service S3.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One area we’d overlooked was the functionality to preview a CSV which is used to give an overview of data files before a user commits to downloading a potentially large file. For very large files the code was using ruby’s low-level &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; API to read in a limited number of bytes of the file from disk. &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/pull/3826"&gt;We changed this to use a HTTP RANGE request instead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We also had to make sure that metadata about each attachment that was previously stored in Whitehall is now stored in Asset Manager. This includes &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager/pull/502"&gt;support for parent document URLs in HTTP headers&lt;/a&gt;. In addition we &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager/pull/512"&gt;continued to add support&lt;/a&gt; for access-limited and draft assets to Asset Manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Warm greetings from the future!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- add content here --&gt;</content>

    <title>Week 479</title>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="week-479"&gt;Week 479&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week we were mostly finishing up our work on the Asset Manager project. We took some time away from that to do a little bit of office-hunting and to do our quarterly “away-day”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="asset-management"&gt;Asset Management&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We were mostly preparing to switch serving attachments from Whitehall to Asset Manager by:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/pull/3881"&gt;Refactoring the related controllers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/pull/3892"&gt;Writing a worker&lt;/a&gt; to handle the migration of metadata&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/pull/3903"&gt;Landing a few changes&lt;/a&gt; from a long-running branch onto &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/pull/3880"&gt;Dealing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager/pull/528"&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager/pull/531"&gt;edge cases&lt;/a&gt; present in the 500,000 assets we’re attempting to migrate.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the end of the week we’d reached the point where we could start running the migration to make sure that all of the assets in Asset Manager had the same draft, redirect and access-limited metadata as they do in Whitehall. Once we’ve ironed out all the inconsistencies we’ll finally make a change to the nginx server and start serving traffic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="office-hunting"&gt;Office Hunting&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have a new member joining in early April which will take Go Free Range up to 4 permanent members. We’re currently using co-working membership at The Office Group. While we’ve been happy with the flexibility this offers there’s a couple of downsides that will get worse when we’re 4. Firstly, it’s quite difficult to find 4 desks next to each other in our preferred co-working space. This is understandable, they’re really designed for individual workers not teams. Secondly, at £375 per desk per month it starts to look financially more sensible to look for some permanent desks somewhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We certainly miss having our own office - we used to be able to host people for short stays working with us, have clients over, and host evening events in our old place on Worship St. With rents steadily climbing though, this may not be possible again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week we took a look at some sub-let desks in a spacious building in Hoxton. We’re going to keep looking for something flexible and keep thinking about a slightly more permanent home for the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="away-day"&gt;Away Day&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We like to get away from the day-to-day work once every 3 months ago and talk about something a bit higher level. This time we spent a couple of hours in a The Office Group meeting room near Bank station, before having a long lunch. On the agenda was our pay and renumeration for the next financial year, our on-going work to change our articles of association and become a legit co-operative and our hopes and aspirations for the coming year with a new member joining.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A particularly interesting discussion was around time-tracking and holidays. We have an informal “take as many days off as you need” policy, but we’re a little worried that we’re not taking the breaks we need when we’re busy, and that without a firmer policy we might be feeling guilty taking time off when others are not. We discussed tracking time worked and time off more closely but felt unsure about the unintended consequences of doing that. We decided to have a standing agenda item in our weekly meetings where we talk about time worked, time taken off, what our work-life balance is like and anything we can change to improve it. We hope that by forcing ourselves to discuss this more regularly it’ll be easier to make small changes to improve things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;‘Til next time!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- add content here --&gt;</content>

His team’s use of &lt;a href="https://www.yubico.com/"&gt;Yubikey’s&lt;/a&gt; as part of their approach to security prompted Chris to simplify and harden the security around all his passwords and sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Yubikey offers &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication"&gt;2-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; by being “something you have” alongside “something you know” (Chris memorises a password). There are various types of Yubikey available. Chris showed us the USB-C version which works with recent Macbooks. There’s also an NFC version which would work with some laptops and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris then went on to explain how the Yubikey fits into the system he now uses to secure all of his accounts and sensitive documents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://gofreerange.com/images/blog/chris_p_authentication.jpeg" alt="A photograph of a whiteboard diagram of Chris's authentication system" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris uses an encryption software called &lt;a href="https://cryptomator.org/"&gt;Cryptomator&lt;/a&gt; that creates an encrypted folder in his Dropbox. The master password for this vault is a password he remembers concatenated with one generated by pressing the button on the Yubikey. Inside the vault is a file that contains passwords and recovery codes for other services as well as other sensitive files.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where possible Chris also likes to use the Yubikey’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor"&gt;Universal 2nd Factor&lt;/a&gt; support to log in to online services. Google, Github, Dropbox and others support this standard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="sliding-puzzles"&gt;Sliding Puzzles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris then gave us a preview of a topic he’s going to talk about in more detail at the &lt;a href="http://lrug.org/meetings/2018/april/"&gt;April London Ruby User Group&lt;/a&gt; meeting: sliding puzzles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuzz/sliding_puzzle/master/frog.jpg" alt="A sliding puzzle featuring a frog. " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris was inspired to play around with sliding puzzles after seeing one mentioned in one of Alan Turing’s papers during a visit to Bletchley Park. It turns out that Sliding Puzzles are used as a model problem in computer science due to their combinatorial complexity. For example, a 4x4 puzzle with one missing tile (a “Fifteen puzzle”) contains 16!/2 (around 10^13) states. Storing all of these states in memory would require a huge amount and therefore calculating the shortest path to a solution, for example, is a tough problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris talked us through some strategies for solving the puzzles efficiently including using invarients (ruling out some moves immediately due to their configuration), and pre-computing solutions to store in an “oracle”. Chris has also been learning Rust by applying it to this problem and has &lt;a href="https://github.com/tuzz/sliding_puzzle_rust"&gt;some code&lt;/a&gt; to pre-compute puzzles much faster than can be done in Ruby.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more - be sure to attend Chris’s LRUG talk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="ethereum"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tom C showed us something he’s been working on with the &lt;a href="https://www.ethereum.org/"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; platform. Starting with the observation that the maximum number of transactions that crypto-currencies like Bitcoin can handle is quite a lot less than what a modern credit-card system like Visa can handle, folks have been thinking of ways to speed things up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://gofreerange.com/images/blog/tom_show_and_tell.jpg" alt="Tom talking about Ethereum." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One approach is to perform transactions on a “side chain” and then periodically reconcile them with the main blockchain. Using such strategies opens up new avenues for bad actors to exploit, and Tom has been researching how these attacks might work and how best to prevent them. The theory uses mathematics derived from the study of games and how, for example, to decide who wins a game if one of the players decides to not complete their move.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="parsec"&gt;Parsec&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ben rounded off the evening for us by giving a quick demo and explanation of &lt;a href="https://parsecgaming.com/"&gt;Parsec&lt;/a&gt;. Ben’s son really wanted to play a game that’s only available on Windows. There’s no Windows machines in Ben’s house so Ben first tried to create a virtual machine on Amazon’s AWS service to run the game. This worked OK, but suffered from some latency that made the game difficult to play. After some research they discovered Parsec which allows virtual gaming machines in the cloud to be efficiently streamed to a local machine. Ben’s really impressed with how easy it was to set up and the performance. And his son got his gaming fix!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- add content here --&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="week-478"&gt;Week 478&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ve spent the week working from &lt;a href="http://space4.tech"&gt;Space4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theofficegroup.co.uk/"&gt;TOG&lt;/a&gt; Bloomsbury and home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming"&gt;paired&lt;/a&gt; more this week than we have for a while. It’s reminded me how much I enjoy it, and how effective it can be. Although we communicate regularly throughout the day, that’s still not quite the same as having two people working through a single problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="asset-manager"&gt;Asset Manager&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re continuing to focus on the GDS &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager"&gt;Asset Manager&lt;/a&gt; work. It feels as though we’re really not too far from being able to serve the &lt;a href="http://github.com/alphagov/whitehall"&gt;Whitehall&lt;/a&gt; attachments from Asset Manager (although it’s felt like that for a while).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ve been improving the Whitehall code by pulling apart some unwieldy logic into more expressive methods. This makes the code easier to understand and helps give us confidence that we’re correctly updating the assets in Asset Manager.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ve also been improving the Whitehall &lt;a href="http://sidekiq.org/"&gt;Sidekiq&lt;/a&gt; workers that communicate with Asset Manager. They’d grown somewhat organically and we’d ended up storing a fair amount of state on the queue. Not only can this state be out of date by the time the job is processed, but storing lots of data on the queue can eat into the memory available to &lt;a href="https://redis.io/"&gt;Redis&lt;/a&gt; (as we discovered in &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/week-473#gds"&gt;week 473&lt;/a&gt;!) The workers now take a single database ID which minimises the memory use and allows us to retrieve the state at job process time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ve added code and a Rake task in preparation for updating the metadata of all Whitehall attachments in Asset Manager. This is the final step before we can switch serving these assets from Asset Manager!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="gfr"&gt;GFR&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We received some more detailed feedback about why we were rejected for the coaching opportunity we mentioned in &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/week-475"&gt;week 475&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve not read through it in detail yet but hopefully it’ll help us understand what we can do to improve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cat and Annie of &lt;a href="http://www.thedotproject.co/"&gt;The Dot Project&lt;/a&gt; continue to do a great job of working with a subset of &lt;a href="https://www.coops.tech/"&gt;CoTech&lt;/a&gt; members to produce something that can be used to sell CoTech services to larger organisations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/james-mead"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; has archived some of our older repositories after we received vulnerability warnings from &lt;a href="https://www.github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/freerange/status/974023264682078208"&gt;fondly remembered Freerange Beards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ve accepted the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation"&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt; variations to the &lt;a href="https://digitalmarketplace.blog.gov.uk/2015/12/07/digital-outcomes-and-specialists-is-open-for-applications/"&gt;Digital Outcomes and Specialists Framework&lt;/a&gt;. The more I read about GDPR the more impressed I am by its intent. I look forward to seeing the back of some of the more underhand practices that certain services employ.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until next time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;– Chris&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I also worked on this system and we often spoke about how we’d love to share what we were doing but never seemed to find the time. Victor has decided to try to post one thing a week with the barrier to publishing being &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ariassp/status/968623155366555648"&gt;something helpful that someone around him didn’t know about&lt;/a&gt;. I think that’s a really good strategy and look forward to reading more. &lt;em&gt;— &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/chris-lowis"&gt;CL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id="what-the-jot-command-can-do-for-youhttpswwwnetworkworldcomarticle3200222linuxwhat-the-jot-command-can-do-for-youhtml"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3200222/linux/what-the-jot-command-can-do-for-you.html"&gt;What the jot command can do for you&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;code&gt;jot&lt;/code&gt; when looking for a way of generating a random number within a range (between 1 and the total number of lines in a text file). I’d not come across it before but it worked perfectly for what I wanted to be able to do. The &lt;code&gt;jot&lt;/code&gt; utility does more than just generate random numbers and this article gives some examples of what it can be used for. &lt;em&gt;— &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/chris-roos"&gt;CR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id="the-proposed-contract-variation-for-digital-outcomes-and-specialists-2httpswwwgovukgovernmentuploadssystemuploadsattachmentdatafile686085proposed-contract-variation-digital-outcomes-and-specialists-2pdf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/686085/proposed-contract-variation-digital-outcomes-and-specialists-2.pdf"&gt;The proposed contract variation for Digital Outcomes and Specialists 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;We were recently asked to agree to GDPR-related changes in the contract for the Digital Outcomes and Specialists Framework. I was really happy to see that the changes were clearly displayed using a diff-like output: red and green highlighting to differentiate between removals and additions. We’ve received numerous contract variations in the past that require fairly significant work to see what’s actually changed so it’s great to see this approach by &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-outcomes-and-specialists-2-framework-agreement"&gt;GDS/CSS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;— &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/chris-roos"&gt;CR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Week 476</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="week-476"&gt;Week 476&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris R spent Monday in Belfast on a short break for his birthday. Happy Birthday Chris! As the end of our current project approaches we poured most of our effort into trying to get the Asset Manager work into a state where we’d be happy to hand things over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ve been facing a bit of a dilemma. For most of the last year on the two projects we’ve worked on for GDS, we’ve approached the development work in the same we always do. By trying to deliver small, incremental changes that add value to the system. We do this so that if circumstances change and we need to change direction, work on something different, or stop work altogether we are able to do so in the knowledge that we’re leaving the system we’re working on in a better state than we found it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the last part of the asset manager work - moving the remaining “attachment” assets from Whitehall to Asset Manager - we have struggled to find a way to break the problem into small pieces that can be delivered separately. We can’t find a way to start serving these assets from Asset Manager (and by proxy, Amazon’s S3 service) without migrating all of the assets, implementing the appropriate permissions system in Asset Manager, and adding functionality to ensure that when editors change the permissions of documents in Whitehall we make sure those changes are also reflected in Asset Manager. As a result, we need to do all of those things before we can finally switch over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whitehall is quite a complicated rails application and the more we work on these aspects the more small, unexpected issues we find. As an example, this week I worked on &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/pull/3826"&gt;changing the CSV preview functionality&lt;/a&gt; (for example, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/603201/Postcode_level_gas_estimates_2015_experimental.csv/preview"&gt;this preview&lt;/a&gt; of a dataset of domestic gas consumption estimates) so that it didn’t rely on reading the file from disk, as shortly we hope the files will no longer be on the disk at all. It was a small change that took quite a bit of time to get right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re worrying a little bit about the possibility of writing a lot of code that doesn’t ultimately allow us to fully switch the serving of these assets to Asset Manager and that this inconsistency might ultimately make it harder for future developers to understand the system than if we just revert back to a previous, more consistent state. We don’t want to have to do that, and we’ll be thinking of ways around it when we talk to GDS in Week 477.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the meantime Chris prepared and delivered a &lt;a href="https://github.com/freerange/gds-asset-manager-presentation"&gt;great, short overview&lt;/a&gt; of the changes we’d made to asset serving at a tech talk in the GDS Whitechapel office. There was a lot of useful discussion after the talk and we think it helped other developers to understand how things have changed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="other-good-things"&gt;Other good things&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday Chris and I spoke to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hazelsheffield"&gt;Hazel Sheffield&lt;/a&gt; who is writing an article about tech co-operatives and &lt;a href="https://www.coops.tech/"&gt;CoTech&lt;/a&gt;. We ended the week with our usual team meeting and retrospective - this time entirely remotely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- add content here --&gt;</content>

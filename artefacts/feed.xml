    <title>Week 446</title>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="week-446"&gt;Week 446&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was another fairly full-on GDS week. We spent Monday, Tuesday and Friday working together at &lt;a href="http://www.theofficegroup.co.uk/"&gt;TOG Bloomsbury&lt;/a&gt;, worked from home on Wednesday, and worked at the new GDS &lt;a href="http://thewhitechapelbuilding.london/building.html"&gt;Whitechapel Building&lt;/a&gt; office on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="gds"&gt;GDS&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We had our fortnightly catch-up about assets on GOV.UK with Daniel Roseman while we were in the GDS office on Thursday. We also took the opportunity to meet up with Antonia Simmons about handing over our work on Manuals Publisher that same afternoon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week, after a lot of back and forth, Chris R finally managed to sort out his security pass for the new GDS building; Chris L &amp;amp; I then followed the same steps and hope to have our passes issued in the not too distant future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id="asset-management"&gt;Asset management&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early in the week, the three of us spent a couple of hours brainstorming possible solutions for storing the “mainstream” assets on S3.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris R &amp;amp; I did a bunch of performance testing of the “streaming from S3” solution for the Asset Manager application. This included running the app on EC2 to get a better understanding of the bottlenecks. We also spiked on &lt;a href="https://kovyrin.net/2010/07/24/nginx-fu-x-accel-redirect-remote/"&gt;using Nginx’s X-Accel feature to proxy from S3&lt;/a&gt; rather than serve directly from the NFS mount. We then did some performance testing on this approach. Unsurprisingly, it was considerably slower than serving directly from the filesystem with the majority of the slowdown being due to the latency of fetching the asset from S3.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the meantime Chris L did battle with &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana"&gt;Kibana&lt;/a&gt; to query the logs to understand the current pattern of requests to the Asset Manager. He also did some useful analysis of the sizes and distribution of assets on the NFS mount.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the week, having seen the performance disadvantages of the “stream from S3” approaches, we started doing some work on a &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager/pull/112"&gt;“redirect to S3” solution&lt;/a&gt;. With this solution the asset is downloaded from the redirection target URL on S3 and so we need to set &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager/pull/109"&gt;Cache-Control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager/pull/111"&gt;Content-Disposition&lt;/a&gt; response headers on the S3 objects themselves at upload time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the middle of all this Chris R somehow found time to &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager/pull/82"&gt;add some handy examples&lt;/a&gt; of how to use the Asset Manager API to the README.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="gfr"&gt;GFR&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3 id="cotech"&gt;CoTech&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://outlandish.com/"&gt;Outlandish&lt;/a&gt; have asked &lt;a href="https://foundersandcoders.com/"&gt;Founders &amp;amp; Coders&lt;/a&gt; to do some user research into improvements they want to make to CoTech and/or the &lt;a href="https://www.coops.tech/"&gt;CoTech website&lt;/a&gt; to “facilitate and simplify collaboration and skills sharing on projects amongst our members”. Chris L spent about 45 mins chatting to Bradley of Founders &amp;amp; Coders answering his questions concerning this user research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prompted by Polly at Outlandish, we all filled in a Doodle poll to help choose a date for a half-day planning session for the annual CoTech get together at &lt;a href="http://www.wortleyhall.org.uk/"&gt;Wortley Hall&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully this planning session will go ahead sometime early in September.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having signed up for a couple of desks the week before, we received our first invoice for the as yet &lt;a href="https://community.coops.tech/t/name-the-new-working-events-space-prizes-to-be-won/310"&gt;unnamed CoTech co-working space&lt;/a&gt; on the floor in Outlandish’s building. We’re really looking forward to seeing how the space turns out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end of the week, I wrapped up a Loomio thread which I’d opened about &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.org/d/dTl08HJL/clarification-of-cotech-decision-making-process"&gt;decision-making within CoTech&lt;/a&gt;. We’d been keen to clarify how the network is going to use Loomio to make decisions. Unfortunately not many people responded and, of those that did, a number weren’t happy with my proposal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the network is going to become effective, I think we’re going to work this out somehow. Hopefully the upcoming session at Outlandish and/or the bigger meeting at Wortley Hall will provide opportunities to move this forward when we’re face-to-face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id="solid-fund"&gt;Solid Fund&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris R asked John Atherton of &lt;a href="https://www.uk.coop/"&gt;Co-operatives UK&lt;/a&gt; about how other co-ops account for contributions to &lt;a href="http://solidfund.coop/"&gt;Solid Fund&lt;/a&gt;. Our accountant doesn’t think they are legitimate business expenses. Via their Loomio group John has asked other Solid Fund members how they account for their contributions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id="teaching"&gt;Teaching&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris L spent the day on Wednesday researching and planning an introductory course to data science using the &lt;a href="https://www.r-project.org/"&gt;R programming language&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve always been keen to run some courses as an alternative to doing client work and Chris’ ideas for this course sound excellent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id="company-meeting"&gt;Company meeting&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;We had our usual Friday afternoon session in &lt;a href="https://www.greeneking-pubs.co.uk/pub/plough-bloomsbury/m2605/"&gt;The Plough&lt;/a&gt; and it felt like one of the more productive ones!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We finalised an ongoing discussion about whether we should have a hard-and-fast “rule” about aiming to keep 6 months of reserves in the bank. I think we agreed that the aspiration is a good one, but it should just be one of a number of factors to consider when making decisions about e.g. what projects we decide to work on (client or internal), how much business development to do, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We also agreed that reserves don’t have to be “in the bank”, i.e. we’re open to other ways of saving/investing our reserves. From my point of view, the most important outcome was that we’re going to try to keep a closer eye on our finances and have added a standing item to our weekly meeting agenda to this effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We revisited some cards which have been kicking around in our main Trello board for some time. I think we’ve done a pretty good job of keeping this board under control in recent months, but a few cards seem to have slipped through the net. It was good to come up with a plan for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id="just-visiting"&gt;Just visiting&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robd"&gt;Rob D&lt;/a&gt; spent most of the day working with us in the TOG co-working space and joined us in the pub after our company meeting. It was interesting to hear what he’s been working on and to hear about some of his plans for the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until next time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;– James&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="week-447"&gt;Week 447&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2 id="unit-4"&gt;Unit 4&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We spent a couple of days working from &lt;a href="http://outlandish.com/"&gt;Outlandish&lt;/a&gt;’s new co-working space (currently known as Unit 4) in Finsbury Park this week. &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/james-mead"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/chris-lowis"&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; were there on Monday and the three of us were there on Wednesday. I like it. It reminds me of our old Worship Street office - even more so as &lt;a href="http://lazyatom.com/"&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt; was also there last week :-) We’ve taken a couple of desks on a trial run to see how it works for us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="gds-asset-manager"&gt;GDS Asset Manager&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We ended up with a bit of a change in direction in our &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager"&gt;Asset Manager&lt;/a&gt; work this week. We started the week with a plan to serve assets directly from &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt; but the more we worked toward it the more nervous I got. I’m concerned that we don’t yet have enough information to decide on a sensible URL structure for the new asset URLs; and that trying to get that information might take quite some time. We’ve agreed to park the idea of serving assets directly from S3 and have decided to revisit the idea of using &lt;a href="https://nginx.org/"&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt; to proxy asset requests to S3. This should hopefully allow us to move the assets from NFS to S3 while continuing to serve them from the existing URLs. Once the assets are on S3 we can then decide whether it’s worth tackling the separate issue of serving them directly from S3.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="show--tell"&gt;Show &amp;amp; Tell&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We hosted our 35th &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/show-and-tell-events"&gt;Show &amp;amp; Tell&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. It was a very wet day in London but fortunately a few folks, including a couple of new faces, braved the rain to join us. James has been assigned to write-up an account of the evening so I won’t go into anymore detail here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="rubyforge"&gt;Rubyforge&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;James published a &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/broken-rubyforge-urls"&gt;blog post about the death of Rubyforge&lt;/a&gt; and the more recent death of some redirects they’d put in place. Seeing the web decay like this makes us sad and James has offered for us to help if we can.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="pensions-and-accounting"&gt;Pensions and accounting&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;James spent some time investigating some odd looking pension payments in our &lt;a href="https://www.freeagent.com/"&gt;FreeAgent&lt;/a&gt; account. It sounds as though he’s been able to explain most of it but still has a small discrepancy we’d like to solve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s all for now. Until next time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;– Chris&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Broken Rubyforge URLs</title>
    <author>
      <name>james-mead</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="broken-rubyforge-urls"&gt;Broken Rubyforge URLs&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;For many years Rubyforge hosted the majority of Ruby libraries - it provided subversion repositories, mailing lists, bug tracking, documentation hosting and much more. However, in recent years it was definitely showing its age and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evanphx/status/399552820380053505"&gt;about 4 years ago it was shutdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this meant that many of the links to Ruby gem documentation from existing blog posts and even pages on &lt;a href="https://rubygems.org/"&gt;rubygems.org&lt;/a&gt; were broken. In an effort to fix this, &lt;a href="http://codon.com/"&gt;Tom Stuart&lt;/a&gt; started &lt;a href="https://github.com/tomstuart/rubyforge-redirects"&gt;this project&lt;/a&gt; to crowd-source new URLs for Ruby gem documentation and setup redirects in the hope that &lt;a href="http://rubycentral.org/"&gt;Ruby Central&lt;/a&gt;, the owners of the &lt;code&gt;rubyforge.org&lt;/code&gt; domain, might be persuaded to run an instance of the project on the domain. Note that an instance of the app is still &lt;a href="http://rubyforge-redirects.herokuapp.com/"&gt;running on Heroku&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point my memory goes a bit hazy and I can’t seem to find any documentary evidence of what actually happened, but I’m pretty sure someone (&lt;a href="https://thomasleecopeland.com/"&gt;Tom Copeland&lt;/a&gt;?) setup some redirects for a number of projects including &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/mocha"&gt;Mocha&lt;/a&gt; - although I don’t think they actually used &lt;a href="https://github.com/tomstuart/rubyforge-redirects"&gt;rubyforge-redirects&lt;/a&gt; to do this. Given that redirects were now in place, I have to confess that my interest waned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, recently I was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/floehopper/status/889589392335138816"&gt;disappointed to discover&lt;/a&gt; that even these redirects seem to have disappeared. Indeed, although Ruby Central still seem to own the domain, it isn’t responding to HTTP traffic at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many historical blog posts and even current gem pages still link to &lt;code&gt;rubyforge.org&lt;/code&gt; URLs, e.g. the “Documentation” link on the &lt;a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/rack/"&gt;Rack gem page&lt;/a&gt;. As Tim Berners-Lee said, &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html"&gt;“cool URIs don’t change”&lt;/a&gt;, so it feels like a real shame that all these URLs have died.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve tried contacting Ruby Central folk via Twitter and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/floehopper/status/889589392335138816"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; to see whether they’d be open to the idea of a community-led project (like Tom’s) taking over the domain to keep these URLs alive, but I haven’t had any reply.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If anyone from Ruby Central is reading this, please &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/mailto:lets@gofreerange.com"&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; - we’d be more than happy to setup, pay for, and maintain an instance of the redirecting app.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="week-446---interesting-links"&gt;Week 446 - Interesting links&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h3 id="learn-vue-2-step-by-stephttpslaracastscomserieslearn-vue-2-step-by-step"&gt;&lt;a href="https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step/"&gt;Learn Vue 2: Step By Step&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working though these tutorials on the JavaScript framework &lt;a href="https://vuejs.org/"&gt;Vue.js&lt;/a&gt;. Each episode is short, practically focussed and well presented. It’s also been very beneficial to see other people attempt the exercises and share them in the comments. It would be great if each episode included the source code but I’m really impressed by the quality of this free resource. &lt;em&gt;— &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/chris-lowis"&gt;CL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id="direnv----unclutter-your-profilehttpsdirenvnet"&gt;&lt;a href="https://direnv.net/"&gt;direnv – Unclutter your .profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This looks like a neat alternative to the Ruby-specific &lt;a href="https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv"&gt;dotenv&lt;/a&gt;. It allows for per-directory shell environment settings without requiring you to add another Gem to your project. Via &lt;a href="https://unboxed.co/blog/unboxed-roundup-our-links-for-w-c-31st-july-2017/"&gt;this recent Unboxed Roundup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;— &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/chris-roos"&gt;CR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id="visualising-transparency-for-alltrials--mysocietyhttpswwwmysocietyorg20170802visualising-transparency-for-alltrials"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2017/08/02/visualising-transparency-for-alltrials/"&gt;Visualising transparency, for AllTrials / mySociety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I saw Ben Goldacre speak about All Trials quite a few years ago but hadn’t really heard anything about it since. I’m pleased to hear that the work has been continuing and the results are now available. &lt;em&gt;— &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/chris-roos"&gt;CR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id="commit-bithttpsgithubcomcucumbercommitbit"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/cucumber/commitbit"&gt;Commit bit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cucumber.io/"&gt;Cucumber&lt;/a&gt; folk have come up with this interesting service to help manage open-source projects on GitHub. The service integrates with GitHub and hands out commit privileges to anyone who gets a pull request accepted. The idea is that this reduces the workload of the existing team and lowers the barrier of entry for new team members. &lt;em&gt;— &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/james-mead"&gt;JM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id="applying-lean-techniques-to-improve-software-engineering-education-pdfhttpswwwdocicacukrbcpapersicse-seet-17pdf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rbc/papers/icse-seet-17.pdf"&gt;Applying Lean Techniques to Improve Software Engineering Education [pdf]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I haven’t had a chance to read it yet, but I was pleased to see that &lt;a href="http://chatley.com/"&gt;Rob Chatley&lt;/a&gt; and his co-author have published this paper on applying lean techniques to their course at Imperial College, London. This is something Rob has talked about a few times at our &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/show-and-tell-events"&gt;Show &amp;amp; Tell events&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;— &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/james-mead"&gt;JM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Week 444</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="week-444"&gt;Week 444&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Happy Friday everyone!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We built up a head of steam this week with our work on improving how assets are stored for &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/"&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;. As I outlined &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/week-443"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; we’re helping them to migrate uploaded assets (for example &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/colombia"&gt;maps attached to travel advice&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spring-budget-2017-documents"&gt;spring budget&lt;/a&gt;) to Amazon’s AWS S3 service.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are working towards a “&lt;a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Walking+skeleton"&gt;walking skeleton&lt;/a&gt;” to test the end-to-end process of uploading assets, storing them from S3 and then serving them to the user. This will help us to uncover any problems earlier, and give us confidence that our proposed approach will work. We’ll also be able to get all of the necessary credentials and connections in place early, which will help us to iterate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We tackled the problem on three fronts:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;We &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-terraform-provisioning/pull/125"&gt;updated the Terraform configuration&lt;/a&gt; to provision the S3 bucket we need and to set up a user with the correct permissions.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/pull/6137"&gt;made sure the environment variables our application needs&lt;/a&gt; were added to the application servers using Puppet; and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager/pull/74"&gt;modified the asset manager&lt;/a&gt; application so that it stores assets to S3 and allows them to be optionally served from S3 for testing purposes.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;We spent a bit of time debugging why the application on the integration servers wasn’t picking up the environment variables we set. In doing so we discovered a useful trick: on Unix-like systems you can inspect the environment that a given process is running in by looking at the file stored in &lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/environ&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the process ID of the, in this case, &lt;a href="https://bogomips.org/unicorn/"&gt;Unicorn&lt;/a&gt; server running the application. This showed us that we needed to restart the application in a particular way in order for it to pick up the new environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Thursday we shared our work so far with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danielroseman"&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt; at GDS and got some useful feedback. It feels like we’re close now to having something working that we can develop further.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also on Thursday I met up with former Free Ranger &lt;a href="http://lazyatom.com/"&gt;James Adam&lt;/a&gt; at Outlandish’s office in Islington. &lt;a href="https://outlandish.com/"&gt;Outlandish&lt;/a&gt; have recently taken over the lease on an empty floor in their building and want to turn it in to a co-working and event space for &lt;a href="http://coops.tech/"&gt;CoTech&lt;/a&gt; members and other small tech businesses. We’re interested in being a part of this project and are considering taking some space there. Outlandish threw a fun office-warming party and invited a lot of interested people to take a look.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other CoTech activity, we stewarded a &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.org/d/W8r3ASkl/allow-greennet-to-join-cotech"&gt;Loomio discussion&lt;/a&gt; to allow a new member to join the network. While the outcome was a little unsatisfactory, it was positive that we can use &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.org/"&gt;Loomio&lt;/a&gt; to have nuanced, difficult discussions and come to a collective decision about how to proceed. We’re going to work hard on clarifying the membership criteria for CoTech so that hopefully this process becomes much simpler in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Along the way Chris wrote a &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/show-and-tell-34"&gt;fantastic summary&lt;/a&gt; of our recent Show and Tell event &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; shared some &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/week-444-links"&gt;delicious links&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have a very good weekend, won’t you?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Not only does it feel faster than Firefox (my previous default) but I’m also really appreciating the simplicity of the single tab browsing experience. &lt;em&gt;— &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/chris-roos"&gt;CR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id="findmypast-family-tree-builderhttpswwwfindmypastcoukfamily-tree"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.findmypast.co.uk/family-tree"&gt;Findmypast Family Tree builder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I started exploring my family history about 15 years ago and have dipped in and out every so often since then. I’ve got back into it recently and have been using Findmypast’s Family Tree functionality to construct my own tree. I’m really impressed by how easy they’ve made it to merge data from their various sources into your own tree. &lt;em&gt;— &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/chris-roos"&gt;CR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id="building-tubealert-a-serverless-progressive-web-site-with-push-notificationshttpswwwhammerspacecoukpoststube-alert-07-2017"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hammerspace.co.uk/posts/tube-alert-07-2017"&gt;Building TubeAlert, a Serverless Progressive Web Site with push notifications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;David Marland built this site to provide alerts when London’s tube network has disruptions. He used React for the front end, Service Worker and push notifications to provide an “app-like” experience, and NodeJS on AWS Lambda for the “serverless” backend. He then spent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/djmarland/status/887949355038244864"&gt;just as long&lt;/a&gt; documenting and explaining the whole thing. A fantastic resource. &lt;em&gt;— &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/chris-lowis"&gt;CL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="show-and-tell-34"&gt;Show and Tell 34&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/james-mead"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; and I were joined by &lt;a href="http://amyeee.com/"&gt;Amy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/beng"&gt;Ben G&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://chris.patuzzo.co.uk/"&gt;Chris P&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cassarani"&gt;Leo&lt;/a&gt; for our 34th Show &amp;amp; Tell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h2 id="hookline"&gt;Hookline&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://gofreerange.com/images/blog/2017-07-12-show-and-tell-34-amy.jpg" alt="Amy demoing the a Hookline product at Show &amp;amp; Tell 34" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amy started the evening by demoing a new &lt;a href="http://hookline.tv/"&gt;Hookline&lt;/a&gt; product they’ve been working on: an online shop allowing content creators (e.g. YouTubers) to purchase music from the Hookline library to accompany their videos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They’ve combined &lt;a href="https://wordpress.com/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://woocommerce.com/"&gt;WooCommerce&lt;/a&gt; and the Hookline music library app to build the shop which is very nearly ready to go. Amy used the opportunity to do some impromptu user-testing with Chris P and hopefully found the feedback and general discussion useful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They’re currently looking for people to help test the service so if you’re interested get in touch with Amy. See the tweet below for details.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Need music for YouTube/online? In exchange for free track download &amp;amp; licence, I&amp;#39;d like to remotely observe you using a new service.

The frustration of arriving at an occupied toilet and having to walk to the other end of the office has lead Ben to investigate ways of indicating whether a toilet is vacant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’s splashed out just over £10 on a couple of wireless motion sensors and a USB SDR device from eBay and has started to investigate how he might use them. The motion sensors broadcast data on a frequency of about 433Mhz and Ben’s using &lt;a href="http://cubicsdr.com/"&gt;CubicSDR&lt;/a&gt; to “see” the data that’s being broadcast. He’s hoping that the sensors contain and broadcast some kind of identifier so that he’s able to differentiate between them and indicate whether a toilet is vacant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It sounds as though this isn’t a problem exclusive to Ben’s office as someone mentioned that &lt;a href="https://madebymany.com/stories/is-the-toilet-free"&gt;Made by Many have also written about solving this problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h2 id="flag-poles-and-x-wing-fighters"&gt;Flag poles and X-Wing fighters&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ben quickly showed us a couple of other smaller things he’s been working on recently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was particularly proud of discovering &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnbuckle"&gt;Turnbuckles&lt;/a&gt; and how they could be used to erect a pirate flag in the garden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Made a pirate flagpole for the pirate part of the garden. &lt;a href="https://t.co/PPVq4zNLCT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PPVq4zNLCT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ben Griffiths (@beng) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/beng/status/879006061348487168"&gt;June 25, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="http://gofreerange.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’s used ball bearings to fix and improve broken static X-Wing mounts with something that allows the fighters to bank in formation :-)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thanks to Dremel and Superglue, replace broken x-wing mount with awesome nd magnet and ball-bearing. &lt;a href="https://t.co/JfvqpZvIJw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JfvqpZvIJw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ben Griffiths (@beng) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/beng/status/868821621552930816"&gt;May 28, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="http://gofreerange.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h2 id="reliving-gps-tracks"&gt;Reliving GPS tracks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I spent two minutes demoing the &lt;a href="https://www.relive.cc/"&gt;Relive&lt;/a&gt; service/app. Connect it to your Garmin, Strava, Endomondo or Polar accounts and wait for it to generate a video showing a flyby of your route. If you run or cycle and use any of the supported accounts then I highly recommend trying it out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h2 id="engine-electronics"&gt;Engine Electronics&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://gofreerange.com/images/blog/2017-07-12-show-and-tell-34-chris-r.jpg" alt="Chris R showing the simple dashboard for his boat" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I spent a couple of minutes explaining how I’d wired the starter motor and glow plugs of my boat engine to a simple wooden dashboard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The work had been a bit of a eye-opener as I’d never really considered what happens when you turn the key in the ignition of a car. Wiring up a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; simple version in a boat has made it feel much less magic!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h2 id="simple-api-with-aws-lambda"&gt;Simple API with AWS Lambda&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While we predominantly rely on &lt;a href="https://harmonia.io"&gt;Harmonia&lt;/a&gt; to distribute tasks between us we occasionally need to assign responsibility manually. I tend to use a snippet of Ruby similar to &lt;code&gt;%w(cl cr jm).shuffle.first&lt;/code&gt; to find an assignee and assume that Chris and James use something similar. Ideally I think we’d use some shared code to do this and I used that as an excuse to play with &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I walked through the creation of a Lambda function and &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/"&gt;API Gateway&lt;/a&gt; to encapsulate a JavaScript version of the Ruby code above. The API Gateway allowed me to execute the function by making a HTTP request to the URL it gave me. I was pleasantly surprised by how relatively easy it was to connect it all together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ben mentioned &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/"&gt;AWS CodeStar&lt;/a&gt; which does everything I did but also gives you a git repository that you can push code to in order to deploy. This sounds great as it addresses one of the concerns I had about lack of commit history when editing code directly in the AWS Lambda interface.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h2 id="vpn"&gt;VPN&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://gofreerange.com/images/blog/2017-07-12-show-and-tell-34-james-m.jpg" alt="James M explaining his VPN set-up at Show &amp;amp; Tell 34" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;James explained how relatively cheap and easy it was to get his own VPN set-up. He rents a cheap server from &lt;a href="https://www.liteserver.nl/"&gt;LiteServer&lt;/a&gt; and has installed OpenVPN using &lt;a href="https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn"&gt;docker-openvpn&lt;/a&gt; and the related &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-run-openvpn-in-a-docker-container-on-ubuntu-14-04"&gt;tutorial from Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. He connects using the open source &lt;a href="https://tunnelblick.net/"&gt;Tunnelblick&lt;/a&gt; client on his Mac.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;James thanks &lt;a href="http://po-ru.com"&gt;Paul B&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://lazyatom.com/"&gt;James A&lt;/a&gt; for their help and inspiration in getting this set-up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h2 id="jekyll-guis"&gt;Jekyll GUIs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;James gave us a quick demo of &lt;a href="https://www.siteleaf.com/"&gt;Siteleaf&lt;/a&gt;: a CMS for static sites. He discovered it as part of our investigation into switching the CoTech website from WordPress to Jekyll as one of the main arguments against Jekyll was the lack of user-friendly editing interface.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was somewhat reassuring to hear Leo say that the marketing department at &lt;a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/"&gt;Geckoboard&lt;/a&gt; have been happily using Siteleaf for quite some time to administer their website.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ben highlighted &lt;a href="https://security.dxw.com"&gt;dxwsecurity&lt;/a&gt; as a useful resource for people hosting WordPress. It sounds as though DXW have people working full time on assessing various security vulnerabilities in WordPress!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h2 id="magic-squares"&gt;Magic Squares&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://gofreerange.com/images/blog/2017-07-12-show-and-tell-34-chris-p.jpg" alt="Chris P explaining Magic Squares at Show &amp;amp; Tell 34" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris P introduced us to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square"&gt;Magic Squares&lt;/a&gt;: square grids of numbers where each row, column and diagonal adds up to the same number (the magic sum).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Square with a magic sum of 21 ------------- | 8 | 9 | 4 | |----|---|----| | 3 | 7 | 11 | |----|---|----| | 10 | 5 | 6 | ------------- &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris went on to explain that there’s such a thing as an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphamagic_square"&gt;Alphamagic Square&lt;/a&gt;. These are special because replacing the number in each square with the number of letters in the English spelling of that number creates a new Magic Square! This is probably more easily understood with an example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Square with a magic sum of 45 -------------- | 18 | 22 | 5 | |----|----|----| | 2 | 15 | 28 | |----|----|----| | 25 | 8 | 12 | -------------- Replace the numbers with their English names -------------------------------------- | eighteen | twentytwo | five | |------------|-----------|-------------| | two | fifteen | twentyeight | |------------|-----------|-------------| | twentyfive | eight | twelve | -------------------------------------- Replace the English names with number of letters and we get a square with a magic sum of 21 ------------- | 8 | 9 | 4 | |----|---|----| | 3 | 7 | 11 | |----|---|----| | 10 | 5 | 6 | ------------- &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris used &lt;a href="http://sentient-lang.org/"&gt;Sentient&lt;/a&gt;, his experimental programming language, to &lt;a href="https://github.com/tuzz/letterwise_magic_squares"&gt;discover a number of doubly Alphamagic squares&lt;/a&gt;! This has earned him a &lt;a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com/2017/05/07/double-alphamagic-squares/"&gt;write-up on Futility Closet&lt;/a&gt; and a mention on the Alphamagic Squares Wikipedia page.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris has also been searching for Alphamagic squares in other languages. He’s already found a number of Alphamagic squares in French but has so far hit the limits of his software when trying to find doubly Alphamagic ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h2 id="geckoboard-remote-control"&gt;Geckoboard remote control&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://gofreerange.com/images/blog/2017-07-12-show-and-tell-34-leo.jpg" alt="Leo demoing the Geckboard mobile &amp;quot;remote&amp;quot; at Show &amp;amp; Tell 34" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leo demoed a prototype that he and three others built during a recent hack week at Geckoboard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leo and the team decided to try to improve the experience of managing Geckoboard &lt;a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/guides/displaying-your-dashboard-on-a-screen/"&gt;dashboards that are being displayed on a big screen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They ended up with a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app"&gt;Progressive Web App&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to use your mobile as a remote to control the dashboards on a TV. You swipe horizontally through the dashboards available on your phone and flick them up toward the TV to select them (a nod toward something seen on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(U.S._TV_series)"&gt;House of Cards&lt;/a&gt;). Leo was demoing on an iPhone but explained that the experience on an Android is even better. Either way, it looked pretty slick from where I was sitting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They initially tried to use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC"&gt;WebRTC&lt;/a&gt; to link the phone and the big screen but had to give up when it became clear that it was going to take too long (they only had a week). They ended up using &lt;a href="https://pusher.com/"&gt;Pusher&lt;/a&gt; which seems to work really well despite initial concerns about lag.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h2 id="show--tell-35"&gt;Show &amp;amp; Tell 35&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re hosting our 35th Show &amp;amp; Tell on Wednesday 9th August. It’s open to all so please &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/contact"&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; if you’d like to join us.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Week 443</title>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="week-443"&gt;Week 443&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hello! I’ve been working from home for most of this week. We had some family staying to help with our new arrival for the first few weeks of his life, but now they’ve gone home we’ve been on our own. It’s been great to spend time together but it’s taken until yesterday until I’ve felt that I’ve settled into a working routine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Working remotely has also reminded me how much I enjoy the company of my colleagues - a few minutes spent with James at &lt;a href="https://www.theofficegroup.co.uk/office/east-side/"&gt;TOG East Side&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday afternoon made Thursday a whole lot more productive, for example. I’ve been experimenting with keeping much more granular lists of the work I need to do when programming. When I am able to concentrate for long spells I can usually keep it in my head, but writing it all down seems to make it much easier to cope with interruptions&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/#fn:1" class="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris and James met up on Tuesday and Wednesday and hosted a very enjoyable &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/show-and-tell-events"&gt;Show and Tell event&lt;/a&gt; over at &lt;a href="http://forgeandco.co.uk/"&gt;Forge and Co&lt;/a&gt; in Shoreditch on Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our work to migrate assets on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/"&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt; to a cloud-based storage system continues. There are currently two systems that manage uploaded assets (images, PDF documents etc.) for GOV.UK. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager"&gt;Asset Manager API&lt;/a&gt; provides a service that a variety of publishing applications integrate with, while the large publishing application &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall"&gt;Whitehall&lt;/a&gt; has its own asset management functionality. Both systems use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave"&gt;Carrierwave&lt;/a&gt; library to store files on disk - with storage managed using an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System"&gt;NFS mount&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week we’ve been working on &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager/pull/63"&gt;adding support for Amazon’s S3 file storage&lt;/a&gt; to the Asset Manager API. As a first step we will upload the assets to &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt; in parallel with the existing storage. This means we can work out any issues with integration without affecting the existing service. The configuration of AWS services used by GOV.UK is &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-terraform-provisioning"&gt;managed using Terraform&lt;/a&gt; so we’ve been getting to grips with how that works so we can add the S3 buckets and permissions that the Asset Manager API will need. Along the way we’ve been tidying up and updating the Asset Manager code, including &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager/pull/66"&gt;making sure the code follows the GOV.UK linting rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the Whitehall application we have two options. Either we migrate the storage for this application from NFS to S3 directly, and then look to remove the duplication between this application and the Asset Manager API. Or, we convert Whitehall to use the Asset Manager API first even if that requires us adding some features to the API that Whitehall needs. We’ve been spiking the latter approach to get a feel for how much work it will be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As we mentioned last week, we’ve also been helping the Smart Answers team to make some changes to how the “start” pages are rendered. Chris &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/pull/3126"&gt;finished up the work on this&lt;/a&gt; and with the help of the team got it merged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- add content here --&gt; &lt;div class="footnotes"&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li id="fn:1"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve been using the &lt;a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Checkboxes.html"&gt;checkboxes feature&lt;/a&gt; in emacs &lt;a href="http://orgmode.org/"&gt;org mode&lt;/a&gt; for lightweight todo lists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Week 441</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="week-441"&gt;Week 441&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having returned from an unsuccessful attempt at the &lt;a href="http://www.montblancmarathon.net/en/home"&gt;Mont Blanc 80km&lt;/a&gt; (I missed the cut-off at about the half way mark) I was away again on Monday to move our houseboat to the boat yard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/james-mead"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; returned from his break in the Isle of Wight on Tuesday and then took the later part of the week to sort a few things at home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="http://gofreerange.com/chris-lowis"&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; for holding the fort while James and I were away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h2 id="cotech"&gt;CoTech&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prompted by a discussion about the complexity of developing the existing &lt;a href="https://www.coops.tech/"&gt;CoTech&lt;/a&gt; website, James and I spent some time spiking on an implementation in &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. We’re confident we can do everything required of the current site and &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that such a migration will leave us with a simpler system. We started drafting a document to use as the basis of a proposal in &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.org/"&gt;Loomio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h2 id="asset-manager"&gt;Asset Manager&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I joined Chris in getting stuck into the Asset Manager work for GDS. We started by digging into the problems we’re trying to solve in order to help us prioritise our work. Feedback from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danielroseman"&gt;Daniel Roseman&lt;/a&gt; helped us formulate a bit of a bit of a plan of action. Chris started to investigate how we might use &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt; to store assets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h2 id="smart-answers"&gt;Smart Answers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I spent Friday reviewing a pull request in &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers"&gt;Smart Answers&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is to split the introduction to the Smart Answer (the page that contains the “Start” button) from the actual content of the Smart Answer. Familiarity with the &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api"&gt;Publishing API&lt;/a&gt; (due to our work with &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/manuals-publisher"&gt;Manuals Publisher&lt;/a&gt;) and with Smart Answers means that I hope I can provide some useful feedback about this change. Ideally I’ll pair with the developers involved as I think that’s going to be more effective (and easier) than trying to communicate asynchronously via comments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h2 id="becoming-a-coop"&gt;Becoming a coop&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris finished converting the &lt;a href="https://www.uk.coop/developing-co-ops/model-governing-documents"&gt;Model governing document&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href="https://www.uk.coop/developing-co-ops/model-governing-documents/worker-co-operative-company-limited-shares"&gt;Worker Co-operative Company Limited by Shares&lt;/a&gt; from a PDF to HTML and has &lt;a href="https://github.com/freerange/coop-model-documents"&gt;made them available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. The hope is that we can track the changes we make to the model document if we decide to adopt them ourselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h2 id="social"&gt;Social&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We met the ever energetic &lt;a href="http://www.thattommyhall.com/"&gt;Tom Hall&lt;/a&gt; for a drink on Tuesday. We had a good evening chatting about work, coops and CoTech.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;James and I hosted our monthly drinks at the &lt;a href="http://www.templebrewhouse.com/"&gt;Temple Brew House&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. It wasn’t too busy and they had a huge selection of delicious beers. We were even joined by GFR alumnus &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomafro"&gt;Tom W&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s all for now. Until next time, folks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;– Chris&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="week-442"&gt;Week 442&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;I felt this week was a bit fragmented and we struggled a bit to find our focus. For various reasons all three of us only met up to work together on Friday, although on three other days two of us did manage to meet up for at least half a day, mostly at &lt;a href="https://www.theofficegroup.co.uk/office/east-side/"&gt;TOG East Side&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier in the week Chris R did &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers/pull/3126"&gt;some good work&lt;/a&gt; helping some GDS developers export &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers"&gt;Smart Answers&lt;/a&gt; “start” pages into the &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/content-store"&gt;Content Store&lt;/a&gt; so they and other “start” pages can be rendered consistently across &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/"&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;. He visited the new &lt;a href="http://thewhitechapelbuilding.london/building.html"&gt;GDS office in Whitechapel&lt;/a&gt; to discuss this face-to-face with the relevant people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At various points during the week, we all got a bit sucked into a &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.org/d/FnHRkxCO"&gt;lengthy discussion&lt;/a&gt; about switching the &lt;a href="https://coops.tech"&gt;CoTech website&lt;/a&gt; from Wordpress to a static generator like Jekyll. I’m not sure we managed to completely explain the advantages of making this change, but I do think a number of important issues have been raised, in particular how to best collaborate online. To this end we’re even more keen to help people within the CoTech network learn how to use tools like &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and Github and hope to organise some skill-sharing sessions in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday we were all working from home and started the day with a useful video/audio catch-up using &lt;a href="https://appear.in"&gt;appear.in&lt;/a&gt;. Although for the first time we had a couple of niggles getting started, in general I’m finding this a better option than Skype or Google Hangouts. In particular I haven’t noticed the usual gradual degradation in audio as the call goes on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Thursday morning, Chris L &amp;amp; I met up at the &lt;a href="https://departmentofcoffee.com/"&gt;Ministry of Coffee &amp;amp; Social Affairs&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.theofficegroup.co.uk/office/133-whitechapel-high-street/"&gt;TOG Whitechapel&lt;/a&gt; foyer. I finished up some tweaking of the documentation Chris had written explaining where we’ve got to with the refactoring of &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/manuals-publisher/"&gt;Manuals Publisher&lt;/a&gt; and added a &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/manuals-publisher/blob/657a1f2084482662230643445af42813ac1be30a/docs/history.md"&gt;potted history of the project&lt;/a&gt; to put it in context. We’re pretty happy with &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/manuals-publisher/blob/657a1f2084482662230643445af42813ac1be30a/README.md#documentation"&gt;the end result&lt;/a&gt;. Chris continued his spike into switching the &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager/"&gt;Asset Manager&lt;/a&gt; to use &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"&gt;AWS Simple Storage Service&lt;/a&gt; (S3).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After lunch we met up with Daniel Roseman, Tim Blair &amp;amp; Paul Bowsher to discuss where we’ve got to with Manuals Publisher and what our plans are for the work on asset management across GOV.UK. They seemed very happy with our Manuals Publisher documentation - Paul said he’s going to hold it up as an example to follow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regarding asset management, we agreed that our main priorities should be firstly to move assets off NFS onto S3 and secondly to reduce code duplication across Asset Manager &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/"&gt;Whitehall&lt;/a&gt; apps. They also introduced us to Steve Harker, the Technical Architect responsible for GOV.UK infrastructure, who explained how our work fitted in to their wider plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Friday we mostly worked on GFR stuff. After a pleasant lunchtime discussion in the sun on a slightly damp patch of grass in &lt;a href="https://www.kingscross.co.uk/pancras-square"&gt;Pancras Square&lt;/a&gt;, we agreed a way to &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.org/d/FnHRkxCO/comment/1409145"&gt;draw a line under&lt;/a&gt; the discussion about the CoTech website mentioned above. Chris R then started trying to make some of the changes to the CoTech website which had precipitated our proposal in the first place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We ended the day with a couple of drinks in the sun next to the canal outside &lt;a href="http://thelighterman.co.uk/"&gt;The Lighterman&lt;/a&gt; where we held our weekly retrospective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s all folks!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;– James&lt;/p&gt;</content>

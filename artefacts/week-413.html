          <h1 id="week-413">Week 413</h1>
          <p>This week we worked almost entirely remotely, except on Wednesday afternoon we met up and worked at the <a href="http://www.theofficegroup.co.uk/office/81-rivington-street/">TOG office on Rivington Street</a> before heading on the <a href="http://gofreerange.dev/show-and-tell-27">Show & Tell event</a> in the evening.</p>
          <h2 id="fun-times">Fun times</h2>
          <p>On Tuesday and Wednesday we allowed ourselves the luxury of working on some fun projects. Chris worked on implementing one-time passwords in Ruby using <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226">the specification</a> in order to understand how it works. This seemed to go pretty well and Chris demonstrated his work at the <a href="http://gofreerange.dev/show-and-tell-27">Show & Tell event</a> on Wednesday.</p>
          <p>I continued work on the auto-sensing chessboard project. Having de-soldered a ribbon cable from the circuit board on which the reed switches are mounted, space constraints forced me to cut a hole in the plastic top of the chessboard in order to mount an IDC socket. Without the appropriate tools, cutting this hole was taking ages. So I popped out to buy a coping saw which made the job a lot easier.</p>
          <p>The next job was to solder the header pins onto the [Teensy++ 2.0][teensy-plus-plus-2.0]. The pins are very small and my soldering skills are very rusty, so I found this a very fiddly task. I found myself wishing I’d spent the extra $3 to have the header pins pre-mounted.</p>
          <h2 id="show--tell">Show & Tell</h2>
          <p>We held our <a href="http://gofreerange.dev/show-and-tell-27">27th Show & Tell event</a> in the (now regular) meeting room at Forge & Co on Shoreditch High Street.</p>
          <p>In preparation for this Chris had a play with the Mac Automator app and the <code>say</code> command to remind people when they’ve used up their allocated slot. I think this worked quite well.</p>
          <h2 id="co-operative-technologists">Co-operative Technologists</h2>
          <p>A fledgling website for the group has been created using Wordpress - kudos to members of <a href="http://outlandish.com/">Outlandish</a>, <a href="http://www.glowboxdesign.co.uk/">Glowbox Designs</a> and <a href="https://www.webarchitects.coop/">Webarchitects</a> for making this happen. We activated our account and made a start on filling in our company details.</p>
          <p>We also voted on a couple of proposals put forward in the <a href="https://www.loomio.org/g/oVwtKDOn/digital-co-ops">Loomio group</a>. These weren’t of much significance in themselves, but it was interesting to see how the voting system worked.</p>
          <p>Having bought tickets to the <a href="https://2017.open.coop/">Open 2017: Platform Cooperatives conference</a> last week, we joined the thread about holding a meet up with fellow Co-operative Technologists on one of the evenings of the conference.</p>
          <h2 id="automation">Automation</h2>
          <p>This year we’ve increasingly been tracking our time using FreeAgent time slips in order to better understand where all our time goes. A while ago we instituted a monthly Harmonia task to generate a report to give us some visibility of this. However, the task was pretty manual and is a bit limiting in what questions we can ask.</p>
          <p>It was my turn to generate this report and I decided to spend some time investigating automating the task. The result was a <a href="https://github.com/freerange/freeagent-scripts">Ruby script using the FreeAgent API</a>. My hope is that this will give us the flexibility to ask more interesting questions about how we spend out time.</p>
          <h2 id="remote-working">Remote working</h2>
          <p>As I mentioned at the beginning of these notes, we spent much of the week working remotely. We’ve struggled a bit to get decent VOIP chats working - often they start OK, but then the quality gradually deteriorates. However, there are so many variables, it’s hard to attribute the problems to any one thing.</p>
          <p>The things we’ve tried that <em>seem</em> to have improved the situation are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>using Skype instead of Google Hangouts</li>
            <li>me using a wired rather than wireless connection at home</li>
            <li>both of us using dedicated microphones/headphones instead of the built-in ones</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="company-day-out">Company day out</h2>
          <p>A little while ago we decided it would be good to arrange a company day out every now and again. The idea is to get away from the day-to-day stuff and do something fun, hopefully giving ourselves the space to do some more big-picture thinking about the company.</p>
          <p>We had a first attempt at this last week when I went over to Hampton Court to meet up with Chris and visit his houseboat. We plan to try to do something like this quarterly from now on.</p>
          <h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>On Friday Chris did a heroic batch of week note writing - we’ve almost caught up with the mammoth backlog!</li>
            <li>We agreed a day rate with the GDS Contracting team and they passed us on to the Capita CL1 team. We both always find the day rate “dance” a difficult process, but on this occasion I think we managed to arrive at a sensible conclusion without too much stress or hassle.</li>
            <li>We had an email discussion with James A about some minor issues we’re having with the Harmonia fairness algorithm.</li>
            <li>The application process for version 2 of the Digital Outcomes and Specialists framework closed - Chris had finalised our application last week.</li>
            <li>We cancelled the monthly drinks for December, because (as usual) the date falls between Xmas and New Year.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Until next time.</p>
          <p>– James</p>

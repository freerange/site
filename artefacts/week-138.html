          <p>It’s so easy to get completely caught up in work that you lose sight of <em>why</em> you’re working.</p>
          <p>With that in mind, we’ve decided to make an effort to take that step back and talk about what’s going on inside <a href="/">Castle GFR</a>. We believe in transparency, so it’s an obvious way to demonstrate that.</p>
          <p>This week it’s my turn. I’m already two days late, and we’ve got a lot to catch up on.</p>
          <h3 id="o2-labs">O2 Labs</h3>
          <p>After handing <a href="https://hashblue.com">#blue</a> to <a href="http://o2labs.co.uk/">O2 Labs</a> at the start of August, we’ve done a bit more work for them exploring how they can help developers to engage with other parts of their infrastructure.</p>
          <p>I wish we could say more, but sometimes clients are a bit sheepish. Fair enough. Perhaps we’ll give the project a codename.</p>
          <h3 id="the-office">The Office</h3>
          <p>For the past few weeks we’ve taken a break from that work to make progress with our new office.</p>
          <p>After walking across most of London - twice - we found a good space just around the corner on <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=worship+street,+ec2&amp;gl=uk&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=0">Worship Street</a>. Chris and I met with our solicitors to go over the lease and generally learn more about what we’re getting ourselves into. We’re hoping to move in within the next few weeks.</p>
          <h3 id="harmonia-the-chaos-administrator">Harmonia, the Chaos Administrator</h3>
          <p>One of the fundamental ideas behind our company is that everyone involved should be a <em>maker</em>, but that doesn’t mean that administrative chores can be ignored. We’ve tried a few different approaches for handling this, but have settled on a simple system that adds a sprinkling of entropy into our operation.</p>
          <p>It started as a simple script called chaos.rb, but we’re pushing more and more into it as we find tasks that fit. For the curious, <a href="http://github.com/freerange/harmonia">it’s called harmonia</a>.</p>
          <h3 id="miscellany">Miscellany</h3>
          <p><a href="/tom-ward">Tom</a> has been exploring <a href="http://github.com/tomafro/tomafro-deploy">a simple set of deployment recipes that leverage git</a>, and we’ve been trying them out. There are a few rough edges, but it looks very promising so far, and it’s <em>very</em> fast.</p>
          <p>We’ve been using <a href="http://highrisehq.com">Highrise</a> to give everyone visibility of what’s going on in the company, but when someone forgets to BCC or forward an email, it causes a hiccup. This wastes time, so we’ve spent a bit of time thinking about other solutions, from a single shared mail account to some custom software. <a href="/james-adam">I</a> have been spiking some scripts to automatically produce a single, searchable view of every email in and out of Free Range. There’s nothing worth looking at yet, and we’re still exploring what flow will really work for our company.</p>

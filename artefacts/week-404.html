          <p><a href="/james-mead">James</a> continued to hold the fort while I spent quite a bit of the week working on the houseboat.</p>
          <h2 id="mocha">Mocha</h2>
          <p>James released <a href="https://github.com/freerange/mocha/releases/tag/v1.2.0">version 1.2 of Mocha</a> on Monday. Yay! Unfortunately, our happiness was short lived as we learnt that this release included some code that could <a href="https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/272">cause the Ruby interpreter to hang</a>. Eeek! James spent a good part of Tuesday and Wednesday investigating the problem before opening <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12832">bug 12832 in the Ruby bug tracker</a>. It was picked up pretty quickly and described as a “showstopper” bug!</p>
          <p>James talked about the release and problems at our Show & Tell on Wednesday. Talking about it gave us an idea for a <a href="https://github.com/freerange/mocha/commit/6f1c8b9b6aa4253c8a990befcb89648f09512242">fix which James applied toward the end of the week</a>. Having successfully applied the fix, we <a href="https://github.com/freerange/mocha/releases/tag/v1.2.1">released v1.2.1</a> on Saturday. Good job, James.</p>
          <h3 id="digital-co-ops-retreat">Digital Co-ops Retreat</h3>
          <p>James booked our train tickets for this event in November. Trying to coordinate various modes of transport meant that this ended up taking a couple of hours. We’ve made a note of it being another task could potentially be handled by an admin assistant.</p>
          <h2 id="hookline">Hookline</h2>
          <p>James did quite a bit of work on the <a href="http://hookline.tv/">Hookline</a> music library app during the week:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Enabled multipart uploads to S3 to fix a problem with uploading a large zip file of the entire music catalog. James was pleasantly surprised by how much easier this was than expected.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Added the Delayed Job web interface so that we can see what’s going on behind the scenes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Made a number of small interface improvements to make the site more consistent.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Enabled the <a href="https://elements.heroku.com/addons/papertrail">Papertrail logging add-on in Heroku</a> so that we have more visibility of the application logs. I’ve not tried it yet but James was impressed by how intuitive and easy to use the interface is.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>These improvements meant that he was able to do the final import of data from Dropbox on Friday before asking Hookline to start using the app in anger. This is a great step and we’re looking forward to getting some real user feedback.</p>
          <h2 id="gfr">GFR</h2>
          <p>I spent some time trying to understand <a href="https://github.com/lazyatom/vanilla-rb">Vanilla</a> and our site in general. I got my hands dirty making a number of changes/improvements which have left me with a much better understanding of how it all works.</p>
          <p>James created a GFR organisation on Heroku. It wasn’t strictly necessary but we thought it might make managing our shared apps slightly easier. It seems as though we’ve had to upgrade our <a href="https://github.com/errbit/errbit">errbit instance</a> to use a paid hobby plan but that doesn’t feel like a bad thing.</p>
          <p>We continued to update our address with various organisations since moving to <a href="https://www.ukpostbox.com/">UK Postbox</a> address.</p>
          <h2 id="show--tell-25">Show & Tell 25</h2>
          <p>We hosted our <a href="/show-and-tell-25">25th Show and Tell</a> on Wednesday evening. It took me ages to write it all up afterwards. Partly because I ended up researching more about the topics that were discussed and partly because I always struggle to turn my notes into coherent(ish) sentences and paragraphs.</p>
          <p>James created a new <a href="https://gfr-show-and-tell-slack.herokuapp.com/">Slack room for our Show and Tell events</a> and deployed <a href="https://github.com/rauchg/slackin">Slackin</a> to Heroku to allow people to join. We have no idea whether it’ll be useful but figured we’d try it given it’s easy to do and feels relatively low risk.</p>

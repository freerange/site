          <p>Yo, yo, yo, my friends. I trust you’re all well.</p>
          <p>I’ve had to struggle through all on my own this week as <a href="/james-mead">James</a> deserted me! Not really; James has actually taken a well deserved break to head into the mountains for some skiing fun. I hope the conditions have been favourable, James.</p>
          <p>I think I’ve just about managed to keep up with the things I was supposed to do; and was happy to have the company of <a href="http://po-ru.com/">Paul B</a>, <a href="http://codon.com/">Tom S</a> and <a href="http://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/">Chris L</a> keeping me sane.</p>
          <p>Tom S hosted the fourth <a href="http://lanyrd.com/series/little-schemer-book-club/">Little Schemer book club</a> meeting in the office on Monday evening. As always, he’s done a great job of <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/computationbook/mmP9TvQJsmQ">documenting their progress</a>.</p>
          <p>I spent some more time this week playing with the office layout. We’ve now almost entirely mirrored the old set-up to give us more room around the projector at the other end of the office. I think this works really well, especially now that we’ve got the projector a little higher and at an angle (thanks for the suggestion, Paul).</p>
          <p>I’ve also had a bit of a play with our wireless network set-up. It turns out that it was pretty much unusable. James and I had avoided this problem by using cables, but Tom and Paul had started to revert to tethering which is bad. Having simplified things a little, we now appear to have a stable wireless network. Sorry about that, Tom and Paul.</p>
          <p>Wednesday evening saw us host the inaugural IndieWeb Homebrew website club. You can read more about that in the <a href="/the-first-london-indieweb-homebrew-website-club">blog post</a>.</p>
          <p>Chris L joined us for a few hours in the office yesterday. It’s always good to see Chris and to learn about the work he’s doing in web audio land.</p>
          <p>All that’s left to say is that James and I are going to be doing a little more work for <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn</a> next week but we’ll explain more about that next time.</p>
          <p>Have great weekends, folks.</p>
          <p>– Chris</p>

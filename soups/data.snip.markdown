Data
----

Over the past few years we've worked with clients to help them do more with the data they collect. We like to think we bring our trademark pragmatism and nous to these projects. We want to help you make more effective use of your data - that can mean robust, "just-enough" engineering, but it also means we'll sit with you, ask questions and puzzle things out together.

If you're collecting data in several different places and want your whole organisation to be able to ask and answer questions, or if the product you're building relies on making sense of data and presenting it in interesting ways to your customers, we can help.

We can **help you to understand your data** by working out how it is collected, how best to model it and how to relate what data you have to the problems your organisation is trying to solve. We'll work together in an agile way so that you don't have to wait to start enjoying the benefits of the work.

We can **build useful and automated data pipelines** to clean up and join together your data. Where possible we'll keep the long term cost of ownership down by recommending and using well-proven open source or software-as-a-service tools like [fivetran](https://www.fivetran.com/) and [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/).

We can **analyse and visualise** your data to make it easier to understand and to present it in a compelling way - either to your colleagues or the wider world. We'll help **train and mentor** your team to use the data and get answers to their own questions.

Here's a few case studies of some of our favourite data projects not-for-profit, charity and commercial clients:

## Lollipop

[Lollipop](https://www.lollipopai.com/) are an early-stage startup who help their customers to do their weekly shop quickly. We worked with them to aggregate data from their web and mobile applications into a data warehouse. We designed the schema of the warehouse to allow anyone in the business to answer questions such as "How quickly is a customer completing their shop?" and "Which recipes are most popular with our vegetarian customers?". We built a robust and well-tested data pipeline using [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) and [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) and provided training and support to the team to use [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) to ask and answer questions.

## The Audience Agency

We worked with [The Audience Agency](https://www.theaudienceagency.org/) to help them develop a new tool for arts and cultural organisation called [Answers](https://www.theaudienceagency.org/audience-finder-data-tools/answers).

We built a custom data pipeline using Ruby and SQL to extract data from ticketing systems, public and propriety datasets and existing databases and present this to customers working in arts and cultural organisations around the UK. They use this data to understand their audiences, work out how to reach under-served communities in their local areas and benchmark themselves against similar sized organisations.

## The Childrenâ€™s Society

We ran an [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) training course for data professionals at [The Children's Society](https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/). They were looking to build on their existing familiarity with Excel and SQL to be able to create compelling data visualisations and use text-mining and statistical modelling techniques in their day-to-day work.

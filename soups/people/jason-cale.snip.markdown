Jase worked with FreeRange from February 2009 until February 2012. While at Go Free Range, he looked after our creative direction, user interface design and front-end development as well as being a great developer in his own right.

Jase has decided to take some time out of software development so he can devote more time to meditation and other creative avenues, but he's still [available](http://jasoncale.com) for occasional software projects.

Since spending a couple of years as an electronic engineer on an [Antarctic research station](http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_bas/our_history/stations_and_refuges/faraday.php) (yes, it was cold; no, there weren't any polar bears), James has spent the last 15 years developing software at a number of [consultancies and startups](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesmead#experience) in the UK and US. After a stint at [Thoughtworks](http://www.thoughtworks.co.uk) working for clients like [Dixons](http://www.dsgiplc.com/), [AOL](http://www.aol.co.uk/) & [Fidelity](http://www.fidelity.co.uk/), he was the first employee at [Reevoo](http://www.reevoo.com/), an early adopter of [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).

He's helped [Headshift](http://www.headshift.com/) develop the website for Antony Gormley's [One & Other](http://www.oneandother.co.uk/) project.

James is the author of [Mocha](http://mocha.rubyforge.org/), a popular Ruby testing framework.

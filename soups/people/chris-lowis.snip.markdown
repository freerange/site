Chris discovered Ruby as an alternative to a mess of shell scripts and
Perl that he was using while working as a researcher at
the [German Aerospace Center][dlr]. Learning Rails distracted him
during his PhD at the [University of Southampton][isvr] but eventually
led to a job as a developer and researcher at [BBC Music][bbc-music]
and later [BBC R&D][bbc-rd]. He spent three and a half years running
the data science team at [FutureLearn][futurelearn] before joining his
friends at GFR in early 2017.

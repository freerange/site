An early career spent using Visual Basic 6 left him searching for something better. He spent a while using .NET before discovering the joy of Ruby and Ruby on Rails in 2005. This early adoption led to a job at [Reevoo][reevoo] where he enjoyed working with [Ben][ben-griffiths], [James A][james-adam] and [James M][james-mead]. After leaving Reevoo, he spent 18 months working on various Rails projects at Headshift before joining GFR in late 2010.

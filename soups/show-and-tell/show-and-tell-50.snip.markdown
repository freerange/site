Show and Tell 50 üçæ
================

This is a belated and hence somewhat patchy write-up of our 50th Show & Tell event which took place on Wed 21 Nov 2018 at [dxw digital][]'s [The Hide][] in Hoxton Square. Since it was the 50th event, we had some pizza from [Radio Alice][] to celebrate along with the usual assortment of beverages. There was a really good turnout with 11 people attending and I thoroughly enjoyed the evening.


## Multi-player Crossword

[Chris Z][] showed us how he's taken the [the crossword from The Guardian's website][guardian-crossword] (which is open-source) and turned it into a multi-player version. He demonstrated a working version, explained how he'd approached building it and some of the technical challenges he'd run into along the way.

Chris has since published [a full write-up on his blog][multiplayer-crosswords] and is [hosting the app on his domain][multicrosser].


## Petition Map

When he was at [Unboxed][], [Murray][] was involved in building the [Petition Map][] which provides a visualisation of people signing petitions on the [UK Government and Parliament Petitions website][e-petitions]. The map colours each electoral constituency according to the percentage of constituents who have signed. One effect of this is that constituencies with a large geographic area are over-emphasised and those with a smaller area are under-emphasised.

Murray talked us through various ways he'd tried to improve on this with his latest iteration being based on [this article on hex mapping][hex-mapping] by the Open Data Institute in Leeds.


## Lego Cards

[Ben G][]'s children had been collecting Lego cards and he showed us a [Monte Carlo simulation][] he'd written in Ruby to work out the probability of collecting a full set.


## Markers Hub

[Rob Chatley][] talked about how student assignment marking is organised for [his courses at Imperial College][rob-chatley-imperial]. A system had been built organically over time by one member of staff using fairly old-school techniques like CGI scripts.

Rob talked about how they were incrementally moving to a more centralised system with the source code hosted on GitHub to encourage other members of staff (and even students?) to contribute.


## Solving a Rubik's Cube

<%= image_tag('blog/2018-11-21-paul-battley-solving-rubiks-cube.jpg', alt: "Paul Battley solving a Rubik's cube") %>

[Paul B][] explained how he'd taught himself to solve a Rubik's cube. Using a simple notation for each move, he was able to memorise combinations of moves to have particular effects.

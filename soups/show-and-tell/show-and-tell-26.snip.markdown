### Tom S - Lambda calculus

* Repl that he demod last night time
  * Showed/used at Computation Club - illustrated that it was hard for people to use - hard to understand the Repl let alone Lambda calculus itself
* Taught in NYC (the thing formerly known as Hacker School?)
  * Demo'd REPL
* Converted it to JavaScript
  * Used Jasmine as testing framework. It's BDD so it was relatively trivial to translate his existing RSpec specs to Jasmine.
* Used React GUI to build interface over the top of the library
* Used Webpack to build an "app" that can be opened in the browser.
* People now ask about Lambda Calculus rather than how the interface works.

### James A - Science Museum Lates

* Demonstrate spread of disease
* "Marketing exercise for the university" (which?)
* Largest game they've run to date
* They used to use pegs + codes but have now switched to QR codes
* Built a visualisation of the spread of disease
* Almost no programming required

### James A - Thermostat

* Bad thermostat in his house
* Could've bought something (e.g. Nest) but decided it'd be fun to make something himself
* It was surprisingly easy
* He used a relay and Spark Core
* USP of board is that you don't have to think about HTTP - contrast this with Arduino where you have to interact with HTTP at a very low level
* Particle HTTP API - 3rd party service?
* First version of the web app - heat-o-tron - allowed him to turn the heating on/off from his computer - i.e. without having to get up and go downstairs
* Using Dweet to send temp. data from Raspberry Pi Zero - this allows him to build a thermostat by turning the heater on if the temperature isn't at a set level
* Next version allows him to set a timer for the heating system to be turned on/off on a schedule

### Alex - Hardware time tracker

* Esprino - £25
* Battery powered 4 year life
* USB powered
* Chrome development environment
* Runs JavaScript
* Includes direction sensor and temperature sensor
* Fibbo? Mesh network
  * £40 for 1/2 switch device
* Esprino / puck.js
* Use case
  * Time tracking with a physical device - Button on/off
  * Point at time/client? on a piece of paper

### Ben/James/Chris

* Ben has migraines
* Been playing more physical games with the kids (e.g. card games)
* Interesting idea to add soundtracks to games - do it manually by playing soundtracks but it'd be good if the music could react to what's happening in the game
* We decided to focus on chess
* Rules engines are relatively easy to use
* Amazing what you can now achieve using JS alone
* Ben moved on to image recognition version so that it could recognise real chess board
* Someone said that it "sounds like how I imagine chess"

### Rob C

* Continuation of the demo he gave last time
* More frequently test students
  * Problem of more frequently needing to mark assignments
* CI like system for students to push their responses to tests and have them automatically marked against a set number of criteria
* They'd like to make it usable outside of the computing department
* Rob was mostly asking for feedback on what they might try
* I think they're using a combination of Gitlab and some inhouse software for the current system
* Create all repos for all students - what does this mean?
* Main objective of the system is to get more feedback to the students quicker
* Code wars - what does this mean?
  * Can run tests against students solution
* Lots of ideas from the group
  * Focussed on using familiar tools to help
    * e.g. GitHub, PRs, branches and tags

Here's a bold snip: {bold}

- Here's a random number between 5 and 15: {rand 5,15}
- Here's a random number between 1 and 90 (the default min): {rand 90}
- Here's a random number between 1 and 100 (the default range): {rand}

And lets include some textile: 

{textile_example}

The source for that was 

{pre textile_example}

And lets include some markdown!: 

{markdown_example}

The source for that was 

{pre markdown_example}

How about some {link_to debug} information: {debug}

What about a missing snip? Lets try to include one: {monkey}

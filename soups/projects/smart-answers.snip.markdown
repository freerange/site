GDS asked if we could help with the development of [Smart Answers][smart-answers] in early 2015.

The app had been somewhat neglected and, as a result, required a lot of effort from the development and content teams to maintain it. Our brief was to reduce this maintenance cost. After initially exploring some alternative implementations we eventually decided to focus on reducing developer effort by improving the existing app.

We spent a good part of the following year refactoring and incrementally improving the code base. We're pretty pleased with where we ended up although there's still an awful lot that can be improved.

GDS asked if we could help with the development of [Smart Answers][smart-answers] in early 2015.

The app had been somewhat neglected and, as a result, it required a lot of effort from the development and content teams to maintain it. We were initially asked to look at building an alternative version that would allow the content team to take on most of the work of building and maintaining Smart Answers.

After some early investigations we agreed that the best thing would be to improve what was already there rather than building something new.

We spent a good part of the following year refactoring and incrementally improving the existing code base. There was still a lot to do when we left but we're relatively confident that we've left it in a better state than it was in previously.

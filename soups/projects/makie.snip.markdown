We spent three weeks working with [Ben G][ben-griffiths] and the [Makie][makielab] team in 2014.

We made improvements to all parts of their system: from the Django app allowing people to design their dolls, to the back office app for stock management, to the Python scripts that managed the 3D rendering process.

We spent three short weeks working with [Ben G][ben-griffiths] and the [Makie][makielab] team in 2014.

We helped make improvements to all parts of their system: from the Django app allowing people to design their dolls, to the back office app for stock management, to the Python scripts that managed the 3D rendering process.

It was a very enjoyable experience despite the steep learning curve and short timescales.

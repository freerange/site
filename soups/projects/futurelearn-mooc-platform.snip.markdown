[FutureLearn][], a start-up founded by the [Open University][], approached us in April 2013 to help build the first UK platform for [massive open online courses][MOOC] (MOOCs). We jumped at the chance to get involved in such an exciting project!

We played an important role in the team from the beginning; promoting a strong agile development culture as we helped ensure the platform was ready for the public launch in September 2013, and then again for the uncapped courses in January 2014.

We think it's a great project, with a great team, and we're proud to have been involved.

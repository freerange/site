We worked with [GDS][] to help deliver the "Single Domain Project" for the UK government. The aim of the project is to deliver a [simpler, smaller, nimbler, cheaper and better gov.uk domain][mlf] for citizens and businesses to interact with the government and its services. This involves consolidating services from the multitude of existing government agency websites into a single, modern and usable system.

Our specific role was to [develop a platform][corp] to allow the various government departments and agencies to communicate with the public about their policies, publications and goals in a uniform way to increase the clarify, usefulness and reusability of that information.

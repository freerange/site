<h2 id="tag">Geohash Explorer</h2>

This was an experimental app built by [Tom W](/tom-ward). You can read more about it in [notes for week 154](/week-154) and Tom's blog post, [A small toy to explore geohashes](https://web.archive.org/web/20140424194828/https://tomafro.net/2011/09/a-small-toy-to-explore-geohashes). And the source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/tomafro/geohash-explorer).

Tom is no longer hosting the app, but [Martin Polley suggests](https://twitter.com/martinpolley/status/1515797976773505031) one of these might be suitable alternatives: [GeoHash Explorer by Chris Hewett](https://chrishewett.com/blog/ geohash-explorer/) or [Geohash Explorer by Alexander Berezovsky](https://geohash.softeng.co/).

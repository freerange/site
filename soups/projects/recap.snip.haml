    deployment recipes, designed to use

    strengths to deploy applications and websites in a fast and simple manner.

  %h2 Features & Aims
  %ul
    %li
      %p
        Releases are managed using git.  All code is deployed to a single directory, and git tags are used to manage different released versions.  No
        = succeed "," do
          %code releases
        %code current
        or
        %code shared
        directories are created, avoiding unnecessary sym-linking.
    %li
      %p
        Deployments do the minimum work possible, using git to determine whether tasks need to run.  e.g. the
        %code bundle:install
        task only runs if the app contains a
        %code Gemfile.lock
        file and it has changed since the last deployment.
    %li
      %p
        Applications have their own user account and group, owning all of that application's associated files and processes.  This gives them a dedicated environment, allowing environment variables to be used for application specific configuration.  Tasks such as
        = succeed "," do
          %code env
        %code env:set
        and
        %code env:edit
        make setting and changing these variables easy.
    %li
      %p Personal accounts are used to deploy to the server, distinct from the application user.  The right to deploy an application is granted simply by adding a user to the application group.

We worked with [Manuel Spitschan](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/manuel-spitschan), a researcher at the University of Oxford, to build [Luox](https://luox.app). As a research scientist, if light has a big impact on your results it is important that you descibe it correctly so that other scientists can reproduce your experiments.

Luox helps you do that by guiding you through the steps you need to take to report your light measurements. We worked with Manuel in a number of 1-week sprints, giving him time between each sprint to talk to users and prioritise improvements for the next iteration.

Luox is built with React and hosted on Netlify. We designed the application to require no server-side components. This makes it cost-effective to maintain and keep running. To build this application we had to turn complicated [CIE](http://cie.co.at/) specifications into [well-tested code](https://github.com/luox-app/luox). You can read more about this project in a [Wellcome Open Research publication](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-69).

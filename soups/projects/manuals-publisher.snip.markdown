The [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk) commissioned us (through the Digital Outcomes and Specialists framework) to help them refactor and improve [a rails application](https://github.com/alphagov/manuals-publisher/) used to publish "manuals" - a type of document format used to publish things such as [The Highway Code](https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving/highway-code-road-safety). We were wary, as ever, of doing a full rewrite and so [incrementally refactored](https://github.com/alphagov/manuals-publisher/graphs/contributors?from=2017-01-05&to=2017-06-18&type=c) the application, upgraded its dependencies and made it much simpler to maintain and improve.

Code Clubs are a global network of free coding clubs run by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. During the global pandemic of 2020 these clubs came abruptly to a halt. We worked with the Raspberry Pi Foundation to build [Code Club World](https://beta.codeclubworld.org) a site that allows children to learn to code at home, while retaining some of the social experience that makes Code Clubs so special.

Forming a multi-disciplinary agile team with the Foundation's own designers, learning technologist and product manager we took Code Club World from concept to public beta in 12 weeks. Using React, Rails and modern browser technologies such as SVG and Web Audio we created a fun, app-like experience that works on any device.

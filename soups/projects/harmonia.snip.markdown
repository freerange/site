[Harmonia][] is a web-based application which captures, schedules and assigns all of the peripheral tasks and chores that a team needs to perform as part of their normal routine.

From writing weeknotes to chasing invoices to hosting social events, Harmonia will assign responsibility for completing each task randomly but fairly within the team, so everyone knows who is taking care of what.

Harmonia was originally developed within [Go Free Range][], but it's now owned and run by [Exciting][] as a commercial service.

  %h2 Borrow a Printer
  %p 
    If you've got a great idea for using Printer, we'd love to help you explore it. We have a very small number of printers that we can loan on a temporary basis.

  %h2 Register interest in a Printer kit
  %p
    You can always buy the components to build a printer yourself, but we thought some people might be interested in purchasing a kit, pre-configured and ready to run.
  %p
    We don't know if we will actually go ahead with this; it depends in large part on the level of interest. The cost of everything required (printer, Arduino components) is probably in the ballpark of Â£80-100.

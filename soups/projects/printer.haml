  %h2 Register interest in a Printer kit
  %p
    You can always buy the components to <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer/wiki/Making-your-own-printer">build a printer yourself</a>, but we thought some people might be interested in purchasing a kit, pre-configured and ready to run.
  %p
    We don't know if we will actually go ahead with this; it depends in large part on the level of interest. The cost of everything required (printer, Arduino, components) is probably in the ballpark of Â£80-100. If you've already got an Arduino, or an Arduino with an Ethernet+SD shield, the cost would be considerably lower.

  %h2 Borrow a Printer
  %p
    If you've got a great idea for using Printer, we'd love to help you explore it. We have a very small number of printers that we can loan on a temporary basis.

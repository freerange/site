After a short break, we agreed to take on a more self-contained project for [FutureLearn][] to improve their video solution. They were using a third-party service both to transcode, store & serve the videos, and to render a client-side video player. However, quite a lot of problems were being reported by users.

Initially we focussed on getting a better understanding of the problems. We then evaluated a number of possible solutions, before homing in on a hybrid solution where we replaced the third-party player with a better open-source alternative while retaining the server-side components of the third-party service.

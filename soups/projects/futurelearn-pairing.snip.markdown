We spent about 3 months between Nov 2014 and Feb 2015 embedded within the development team at FutureLearn. Our remit was to share and help develop best practices within the team. We approached this by pairing with different members of the team to deliver product features in the backlog.

We wrapped the project up by preparing and delivering a [presentation about pair programming][futurelearn-pair-programming-presentation].

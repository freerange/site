We worked with the [Crown Commerical Service](https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk) (via [dxw digital](https://www.dxw.com/)) to prototype and build a digital service for public sector organisations to buy value-for-money goods and services in an efficient way. The project focussed on [a service for schools to find supply teachers and agency workers](https://marketplace.service.crowncommercial.gov.uk/supply-teachers) which was developed in collaboration with [DfE](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education) and launched in January 2019.

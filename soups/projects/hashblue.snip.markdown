[O2][] approached Go Free Range to explore new approaches to software development, database technologies and open collaboration with their customers. We built a working prototype / beta replicating one of [O2's existing products][Bluebook] which let customers access text messages online. Working iteratively, we designed and built an API to securely expose this data, and #blue, a front-end application which consumes this data.

We then worked with O2 to scale and integrate the service directly into O2's data network, allowing it to support hundreds of thousands of customers, whilst remaining responsive to the feedback and direction provided by the users of #blue.

After getting their development team up to speed, we have now handed principal development of #blue over to [O2][] to continue the rollout to all their customers.

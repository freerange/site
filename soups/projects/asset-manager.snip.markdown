The [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk) publishing system stores, processes and serves millions of assets - typically PDF documents that provide  information to citizens but also things like pictures of politicians. In order to reduce costs and improve reliability we helped the team migrate 6 different publishing systems to use a single [asset management API](https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager) and moved all of the assets from self-hosted servers to Amazon's AWS platform.

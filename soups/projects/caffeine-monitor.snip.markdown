We were approached by [Build][] to work with [Nicholas Felton][] and develop a tool for gathering and displaying consumption of caffeine during the conference.

Using a custom HTML5 application running on iPhones, vendors recorded purchases of tea and coffee, and an array of statistics were projected and displayed on screens around the conference.

Read more about the project in our [blog post](/building-caffeine-monitor), or see a frozen version [here](http://cm.buildconf.com).

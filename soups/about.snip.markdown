Founded in 2009, Go Free Range is a worker co-operative with some of the most experienced application developers in the UK.

We pair our extensive development experience with the complementary non-development skills necessary to give software projects the best chance of success.

As worker-owners we have a vested interest in your project: success for you means success for us.

We work really hard to add value beyond being just units of developer resource. We're a fully fledged team that work well together, and have done for many years. We think we’re most effective when working closely with the client to shape the direction of the product.

Although Ruby and Rails is what brought us together, our many years of experience mean that we’re comfortable turning our hand to most languages. Collectively we have experience of Java, Python, Swift, JavaScript and more although we believe the approach is more important than the language or framework.

We’ve worked on substantial projects for the likes of [O2][o2], the [Government Digital Service][gds] and [FutureLearn][futurelearn], an offshoot of the Open University.

### [1Password 4's Multiple vaults](http://learn.agilebits.com/1Password4/Mac/en/Features/multiple-vaults.html)

I've only just read about this feature that was introduced in 1Password 4. We haven't tried it yet but I think it might make our GFR shared secrets slightly easier to manage: At the moment we use a shared Apple Keychain (stored on Dropbox) but it's easy for that to drift from our personal 1password copies of the same secrets. {by chris-roos}

### [1Password 4's Multiple vaults](http://learn.agilebits.com/1Password4/Mac/en/Features/multiple-vaults.html)

I've only just read about this feature that was introduced in 1Password 4. We haven't tried it yet but I think it might make our GFR shared secrets slightly easier to manage: At the moment we use a shared Apple Keychain (stored on Dropbox) but it's easy for that to drift from our personal 1password copies of the same secrets. {by chris-roos}


### [The Essential Management Book You're Not Reading](http://www.inc.com/magazine/201312/leigh-buchanan/coding-book-contains-leadership-ideas.html)

I love it that Kent Beck's [Extreme Programming Explained](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChangeSecondEdition) is now "gaining a cult status for its simple leadership ideas". {by james-mead}


### [Bitcoins: The Second Biggest Ponzi Scheme in History](http://www.garynorth.com/public/11828.cfm)

This article explains why bitcoins are not money. Worth a read. {by james-mead}


### [Programming Deliberately](http://r.eali.st/programming-deliberately)

I enjoyed reading this article by Alan Francis and being reminded of the corresponding [extract from the Pragmatic Programmer](http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/coincidence). {by james-mead}

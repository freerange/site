### [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)

We've agreed to abide by the [Ruby style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) on our current project. While it's great to have a set of agreed upon guidelines, it's not always easy to remember what they are while you're in the middle of coding; particularly if you have a slightly different individual style. Personally, I'd rather have a computer tell me that I've violated any given guideline than have to keep on top of it myself, and it looks like we might be able to use Rubocop to do just that. {by chris-roos}


### [Quick Javascript Switcher](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-javascript-switcher/geddoclleiomckbhadiaipdggiiccfje)

I've been looking for a Chrome extension to do this (toggle Javascript on/off) on and off *forever*, so was really very pleased to come across this last week. It sits in your toolbar and allows you to toggle Javascript on and off without having to go through the pain of finding the setting in Chrome preferences and then reloading the page. {by chris-roos}

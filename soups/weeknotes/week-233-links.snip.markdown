### [The 25 Most Audacious Companies](http://www.inc.com/audacious-companies)

I was interested to see that quite a few of these seemed to have been picked by virtue of their democratic company structure and/or collaborative culture - from [Morning Star](http://www.inc.com/audacious-companies/leigh-buchanan/morning-star.html), the world's largest tomato processor, where "employees make all the decisions" to [Menlo](http://www.inc.com/audacious-companies/leigh-buchanan/menlo-innovations.html) where they take pair-programming to an extreme. {by james-mead}

### [Packer](http://www.packer.io/)

I'm always interested in tools to help build servers and development environments, so it's natural that packer piqued my interest.  Put simply, it aims to make it easy to create machine images across a number of platforms.  Being able to easily build an AMI image, for example, allows you to have an image with your app already pre-installed.  Scaling would then just be a case of launching new instances.  This idea of immutable disposable servers seems to me to be clearly the way things are heading.  Packer takes us a step closer to this goal. {by tom-ward}

### [Orca: because building servers shouldn't be a PITA](https://github.com/andykent/orca)

I still find it takes me a while to get my head round the syntax and structure of Puppet and Chef. I'm sure this is mostly because I don't do it often enough, but I'm interested in this project which provides a simpler alternative where you only need to provision a few machines and all on the same OS and platform. {by james-mead}

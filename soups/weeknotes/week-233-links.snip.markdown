### [The 25 Most Audacious Companies](http://www.inc.com/audacious-companies)

I was interested to see that quite a few of these seemed to have been picked by virtue of their democratic company structure and/or collaborative culture - from [Morning Star](http://www.inc.com/audacious-companies/leigh-buchanan/morning-star.html), the world's largest tomato processor, where "employees make all the decisions" to [Menlo](http://www.inc.com/audacious-companies/leigh-buchanan/menlo-innovations.html) where they take pair-programming to an extreme. {by james-mead}


### [Orca: because building servers shouldn't be a PITA](https://github.com/andykent/orca)

I still find it takes me a while to get my head round the syntax and structure of Puppet and Chef. I'm sure this is mostly because I don't do it often enough, but I'm interested in this project which provides a simpler alternative where you only need to provision a few machines and all on the same OS and platform. {by james-mead}

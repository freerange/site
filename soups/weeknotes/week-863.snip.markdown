Week 863
========

A short update this week. [Chris](/chris-roos) has been on leave and James, Seb and I have mostly been working on [our project](https://experience-cs.org) with the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

Experience CS will support teachers and students in the US and Canada and we're aiming to make the content available in Spanish and French as well as English. This week we've been doing the work to make that translation possible. We have to support translation of the user interface (which is made fairly straight-forward by Rails' i18n system), the contents of the database and the Scratch projects that have been developed. We're integrating with [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) so that all these types of content can be translated by the team via the same interface.

We had a couple of discussions about whether to make the locale (e.g. `en`) a part of the URL, or to use the browser [`Accept-Language` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept-Language) and a cookie for persistence. We couldn't really decide which was "best" and there seems to be examples of both out in the wild. If you have reckons, please [let us know](mailto:lets@gofreerange.com)!

I attended the monthly [CoTech Community Call](https://wiki.cotech.coop/wiki/Calls) and had a follow up discussion with Richard from [Agile Collective](https://agile.coop/) and Ben from [creative.coop](https://creative.coop/). We're trying to work out what to do with the CoTech bank account and how best to support some exciting activities we have planned over the next few months.

Have a good weekend!

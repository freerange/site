Monday Links - 219
============

Here are a few links and ideas we've been thinking about over the last week.

### [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)

Ostensibly a replacement for [ack](http://betterthangrep.com/), it claims to be 3-5x faster again, and respects any ignore settings in your project (like `.gitignore`). I use Sublime Text 2 these days, and I'm not sure what it uses for searching underneath the hood ([this post](http://sublimetext.userecho.com/topic/90214-add-ack-search-in-project/) suggests it's an ack variant); ultimately integration with your workflow is going to be determine whether or not this is useful, but even so it could be handy just in the Terminal. {by james-adam}

### [Building a GOV.UK exhibit](http://codon.com/building-a-govuk-exhibit)

{l james-mead,James M} mentioned our sneak peek of this in the [Week 217 notes](/week-217#designs-of-the-year). Tom Stuart has an excellent write-up about how he sychronised browsing across a suite of devices to demonstrate the responsive nature of the [GOV.UK](http://www.gov.uk) design. It's being shown at the [Design Museum](http://designmuseum.org/) as part of the [2013 Designs of the Year awards](http://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/2013/designs-of-the-year-2013). {by james-adam}

Monday Links - 219
============

Here are a few links and ideas we've been thinking about over the last week.

### [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)

Ostensibly a replacement for [ack](http://betterthangrep.com/), it claims to be 3-5x faster again, and respects any ignore settings in your project (like `.gitignore`). I use Sublime Text 2 these days, and I'm not sure what it uses for searching underneath the hood ([this post](http://sublimetext.userecho.com/topic/90214-add-ack-search-in-project/) suggests it's an ack variant); ultimately integration with your workflow is going to be determine whether or not this is useful, but even so it could be handy just in the Terminal. {by james-adam}

Monday Links - 219
============

Here are a few links and ideas we've been thinking about over the last week.

### [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)

Ostensibly a replacement for [ack](http://betterthangrep.com/), it claims to be 3-5x faster again, and respects any ignore settings in your project (like `.gitignore`). I use Sublime Text 2 these days, and I'm not sure what it uses for searching underneath the hood ([this post](http://sublimetext.userecho.com/topic/90214-add-ack-search-in-project/) suggests it's an ack variant); ultimately integration with your workflow is going to be determine whether or not this is useful, but even so it could be handy just in the Terminal. {by james-adam}

### [Building a GOV.UK exhibit](http://codon.com/building-a-govuk-exhibit)

{l james-mead,James M} mentioned our sneak peek of this in the [Week 217 notes](/week-217#designs-of-the-year). Tom Stuart has an excellent write-up about how he sychronised browsing across a suite of devices to demonstrate the responsive nature of the [GOV.UK](http://www.gov.uk) design. It's being shown at the [Design Museum](http://designmuseum.org/) as part of the [2013 Designs of the Year awards](http://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/2013/designs-of-the-year-2013). {by james-adam}

### [Don't be a free user](http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/)

Given the announcement about Google Reader shutting down, this post from December 2011 is surprisingly relevant. We run quite a lot of our business on free web-based software from Google, but even if we paid Google I'm not convinced that they wouldn't consider shutting Google Apps For Your Domain. It all comes down to whether or not the interests of the customer align with those of the service provider, and most of us are only useful to Google gun we are providing them with data or clicking on ads. Hmm. {by james-adam}

### [A FizzBuzz fit for the enterprise](https://github.com/Mikkeren/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition)

As developers, we've all had to write implementations of [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/Mikkeren/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) at one time or another.  These versions might be good enough to get a job, but where can one find a version that's fit for the enterprise market?  Lucikly Mikael Kragbæk has [the answer to the question nobody asked](https://github.com/Mikkeren/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition). {by tom-ward}

### [Kernel#backtrace](http://nathaniel.talbott.ws/blog/2013/03/11/backtrace/)

Here's a quick tip to get a backtrace in ruby.  So simple, it's almost worth the cost of reopening Kernel. {by tom-ward}

### [Infographic as menu](http://instagram.com/p/XNmkKjDOLk/)

This menu can be found in [an old furniture shop in Stoke Newington](http://www.meanwhilespace.com/projects/current/stoke-newington-furniture-shop/) that's now being used as a café, to build furniture, and for displaying local artists.  I spotted the menu on Saturday, but credit goes to my friend Steve Guy for having the presence of mind to take a picture.  {by tomw-ward}

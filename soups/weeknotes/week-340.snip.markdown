Week 340
========

Afternoon y'all.

It's really rather rainy here in London today. I imagine it'll just last the day and then we'll be back to a blazing hot Summer again. Probably.

It's been an incredibly short week this week. [James][] has been on holiday and I've had a couple of days off for a wedding (good times) and a funeral (sad times).

I spent Tuesday and Thursday working on [Smart Answers][], and today's been spent catching up on GFR things.

## Smart Answers

* [Tadas][] did a great job fixing a couple of errors I'd managed to introduce when switching to ERB templates for [childcare-costs-for-tax-credits][PR 1827] and [calculate-state-pension][PR 1826]. We're really trying to avoid impacting Tadas's work so it was a bit disappointing that these problems managed to slip through the net.

* I merged my branch to [switch maternity-paternity-calculator to use ERB templates][PR 1822].

* I merged my branch to [add support for indented ERB templates][PR 1824].

* I indented the outcome templates for 31 of 35 Smart Answers now that it's possible.

* I had my change to [add the `page` option to our Analytics tracking accepted in the govuk_frontend_toolkit][PR 203].

## GFR

* Organised [Show and Tell 15][]. Sign up to [Show and Tell mailing list][] if you're interested in hearing about these upcoming events.

* Published [week links for week 340](/week-340-links).

* [Chris L][] spent the afternoon here and published [Web Audio Weekly 44][WAW 44].

Until next time.

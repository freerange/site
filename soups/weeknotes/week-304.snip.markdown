Week 304
========

* James and I resumed working with [FutureLearn][]. We're happy to be back and have been busying ourselves by getting stuck in to working with the team again.

* We spent Wednesday at GFR HQ (we're doing four days a week with FutureLearn) and filled it with writing blog posts and generally trying to keep on top of company admin.

* I wrote about [Harmonia][] and how we use it to keep our company running.

* James wrote and published our fortnightly [Weeklinks][].

* James added some information about [GFR Video][] to our website but we didn't get chance to do any further work on it.

* We hosted our [7th Show and Tell][] on Wednesday evening.

* I took Friday off to travel to Wales to take part in the [Brecon Beacons Ultra][].

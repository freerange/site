### [Google Photos](http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/picture-this-fresh-approach-to-photos.html)

I've recently moved all my data, including my photos, from Dropbox to Google Drive. I was part way through the migration when Google Photos was released and was pleasantly surprised when the Assistant started presenting me with highlights it found in my old photos. I really like being able to store my photos on my computer in my chosen directory structure, have them synced to Google Drive and then have Google Photos sit on top of them as an alternative interface. {by chris-roos}


### [Exposed: Magicians, Psychics and Frauds](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04ndsb3)

I really enjoyed this documentary about James 'The Amazing' Randi. As a magician, James started noticing the tricks he knew being used to take advantage of vulnerable people. Frustrated with the situation, he seems to have made it his life work to fight these fraudsters. A very entertaining, and at times emotional, film. {by chris-roos}


### [Google Analytics Debugger](Google Analytics Debugger)

This Chrome extension came in really handy when I was trying to understand whether I'd configured Google Analytics correctly while doing some work on [Smart Answers](https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers). {by chris-roos}

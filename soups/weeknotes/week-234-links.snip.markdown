### [Questions I ask myself about working as distributed team](http://joel.is/post/54284926855/questions-i-ask-myself-about-working-as-distributed)

I've always been interested in what we can do to work effectively when people are remote, but never more so now that I'm nearly 5000 miles away. Some of the advice here echoes other sources (i.e. make an effort to keep all communication visible to the remote workers), but I've yet to read any advice about how to handle the timezone differences. At the moment I've been starting work at 7am CDT in order to maximise the overlap with GMT. {by james-adam}


### [A Dark Room](http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/)

This is the second 'start-from-nothing' HTML/JS-based game I've seen in as many months (the other was [Candy Box](http://candies.aniwey.net/)). There's definitely something engaging about they way the games unfold as you progress. I got bored playing Candy Box after a while and hacked the Javascript via my browser console, but I've been playing A Dark Room faithfully for a few days now. {by james-adam}


### [Inbox Zero for Life](http://xph.us/2013/01/22/inbox-zero-for-life.html)

I've used the '[inbox zero](http://inboxzero.com/)' practice on-and-off for a few years, and when I manage to stick to it I do find that it really helps. This article takes that further by showing the specific keyboard shortcuts and implementation details (e.g. use stars for emails that need further attention) to make it work with the Gmail web UI. The only problem I have is that the Gmail web UI doesn't really work well with multiple accounts, but maybe that's a good thing rather than a problem; keep emails from a particular context totally out of mind until you choose to read them? {by james-adam}


### [Building a mocking library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aYdtS7FZJA)

This is a video of a talk by Andy Lindeman at the Ancient City Ruby conference 2013. I think Andy's test-driven approach works well and he provides a clear explanation of some of the key issues involves in writing a mocking library in Ruby. His [example library](https://github.com/alindeman/ancient_mock) is loosely based on the newer RSpec syntax discussed in [this issue](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/issues/153) on Github.

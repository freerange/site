Week 573
========

Week commencing 6 Jan 2020.

Happy New Year! I hope you all had a splendid time over Christmas and New Year.

- We weren't particularly good at writing weeknotes last year. To the extent that toward the end of the year we collectively agreed to remove them from our list of shared responsibilities. In drafting a 2019 review blog post I found those that we did write useful material so I'm going to attempt to keep the tradition alive.

- James spent some time over the Christmas period continuing to familiarise himself with AWS and the AWS CDK. He's started work on a URL shortener that we're hoping to use on gfr.coop, and he's automated one of our regular manual tasks that involes backing up our Google Drive to S3. Thanks, James!

- We eased ourselves back to work on Monday by catching up on some admin, reviewing our cashflow forecast and discussing the next phase of the TAA project.

- We spent the remainder of the week working on the TAA project. I'm particularly pleased that we've agreed to aim for making the app available to a subset of users by the end of the sprint. This will force us to make the app production ready and should help us focus on what's really important before we're happy for real people to be using it.

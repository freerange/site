## GFR

* James listened to a rehearsal of Chris L's upcoming conference talk.

* James hosted our monthly drinks on Wednesday. The original plan was to meet at The Singer Tavern but it was too busy/noisy and so they moved on to The Old King's Head.

* We had ongoing email conversations about our plans to work at GDS.

* Received a replacement Certificate of Incorporation. We had an electronic copy of this but it hadn't been accepted when we'd tried to use it to set-up business mail redirection in the past.

* Conversations with our accountant, Paul, as he worked on the annual accounts.

* Received our countersigned agreement for the Digital Outcomes and Specialists Framework (DOSF).

* Created our MISO account to handle reporting requirements for DOSF.

* Agreed to a retrospective for the Benefit Cap Calculator changes discussed in [week 379][week-379].

* James wrote to Aegon to instruct them to increase my pension payments.

* James investigated new GitHub plans and we agreed to stick with what we have.

* James investigated submitting our VAT return monthly. We wonder whether this'll reduce the pain of submitting it monthly.

* James upgraded Rails in GFR Video and Hookline music library apps based on recent security vulnerability announcements.

Week 250
========

[Hey you guys](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMj0t7sds7I).

I'm going to keep these super short and sweet as it's very nearly [beer o'clock](http://isitbeeroclock.com/).

[This week we have been mostly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-z5T8meC84): welcoming James M back from his holidays, trying to determine the value of the company in order to pay Tommo his fair share of the monies, making progress with subletting the office and keeping busy on FutureLearn.

See. I told you they'd be super short and sweet. I hope y'all have a great weekend.

-- Chris

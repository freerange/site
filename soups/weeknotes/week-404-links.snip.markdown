### [English man spends 11 hours trying to make cup of tea with Wi-Fi kettle](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/12/english-man-spends-11-hours-trying-to-make-cup-of-tea-with-wi-fi-kettle)

Chris pointed me at this amusing article. He said it reminded him of my [Just Boiled project][] from 3 years ago which I'd completely forgotten about! {by james-mead}

### [Hackpad](https://github.com/dropbox/hackpad)

I recently spent a bit of time investigating [Gollum][], the git-backed wiki. I'm interested in a wiki-like thing both for personal & company use. I'd completely forgotten that Dropbox has open-sourced [Hackpad][] and recently had a go at firing it up on my laptop. {by james-mead}

### [Big decision ahead? Just roll the dice](http://timharford.com/2016/10/big-decision-ahead-just-roll-the-dice/)

We already [use randomness in the assignment of tasks][Harmonia] within our company. Perhaps we should be using it to help us make difficult decisions!

> [...] most of us could do with a little more randomness in our lives. The roll of a die or the toss of a coin can actually help us make better decisions.
>
> [...] by pre-committing to follow a random instruction, we can end up making decisions that we should have been making all along.

Definitely food for thought! {by james-mead}

### [Crash: how computers are setting us up for disaster](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/crash-how-computers-are-setting-us-up-disaster)

This article starts by talking about the causes of the crash of Air France flight 447. It suggests that, because of automation, modern pilots often have very little experience of flying a plane manually, but may be called upon to do so under extreme circumstances as in this plane crash. It talks about this as the [paradox of automation][]:

> The better the automatic systems, the more out-of-practice human operators will be, and the more extreme the situations they will have to face.

There's a nice story about [Monderman's squareabout][] too. All in all an excellent read. {by james-mead}

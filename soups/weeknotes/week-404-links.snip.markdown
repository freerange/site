Week 404 - Interesting links
============================

### [English man spends 11 hours trying to make cup of tea with Wi-Fi kettle](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/12/english-man-spends-11-hours-trying-to-make-cup-of-tea-with-wi-fi-kettle)

Chris pointed me at this amusing article. He said it reminded him of my [Just Boiled project][] from 3 years ago which I'd completely forgotten about! {by james-mead}

### [Hackpad](https://github.com/dropbox/hackpad)

I recently spent a bit of time investigating [Gollum][], the git-backed wiki. I'm interested in a wiki-like thing both for personal & company use. I'd completely forgotten that Dropbox has open-sourced [Hackpad][] and recently had a go at firing it up on my laptop. {by james-mead}

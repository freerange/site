### [Stop working (so hard)](https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/ef4772e3c628)

"Nowadays, I’m working 4-day weeks, and doing no more than an hour or two of intense work at a time. I take a lot of walks. I’ve lost weight. I’m happier. My wife is happier. I’m more present." I know this is going to resonate with a lot of people (I'm not looking at anyone in particular, {l chris-roos,Chris}) but it's not about just taking things easy and worrying less.

The important point here, which is all too easy to miss, is the definition of __concrete boundaries__ (in the authors case, some number of hours of work per week that's under 35). Picking a specific goal and then sticking to it -- or, in otherwords, __wholeheartedly adopting a constraint__ -- can be liberating. {by james-adam}

Pry open your eyes with matchsticks and let the *interesting* flow straight into your brain.

### [Stop working (so hard)](https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/ef4772e3c628)

"Nowadays, I’m working 4-day weeks, and doing no more than an hour or two of intense work at a time. I take a lot of walks. I’ve lost weight. I’m happier. My wife is happier. I’m more present." I know this is going to resonate with a lot of people (I'm not looking at anyone in particular, {l chris-roos,Chris}) but it's not about just taking things easy and worrying less.

The important point here, which is all too easy to miss, is the definition of __concrete boundaries__ (in the authors case, some number of hours of work per week that's under 35). Picking a specific goal and then sticking to it -- or, in otherwords, __wholeheartedly adopting a constraint__ -- can be liberating. {by james-adam}


### [Teehan+Lax Site](http://www.teehanlax.com/)

There's so much to love about the way this site is designed, it's hard to know where to start. [Great, bold, image-rich pages](http://www.teehanlax.com/story/readability/), thoughtfully-presented and often interactive information about their projects (and a focus on [the challenges and approaches](http://www.teehanlax.com/story/stackup/), rather than a by-the-numbers "this is what we did"), and lots of great little touches too, like hiding the site navigation unless you scroll up a little bit, at which point it slides back in from the top. (And, unsurprisingly, I also found reading about [the history of how they built their company](http://www.teehanlax.com/story/teehan-lax/) very interesting.) {by james-adam}

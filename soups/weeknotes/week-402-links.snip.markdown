Week 402 - Interesting links
============================

### [Credit Union Mobile Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=coop.cornerstone.cumobile)

As we feared there has been precious little public news about the progress of the [Credit Union Expansion Programme](https://github.com/freerange/bank/wiki/Credit-Union-Expansion-Project) over the last couple of years. However, I recently came across a couple of ABCUL [blog](http://abcul.org/media-and-research/news/view/738) [posts](http://abcul.org/media-and-research/news/view/741) which suggested that a couple of [credit](https://www.retailcure.org.uk/) [unions](https://www.elcu.co.uk/) are live with this mobile banking app. There is also an [equivalent iPhone app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/credit-union-mobile/id1064060797?mt=8).

From what I've read, it looks as if the subsidiary of ABCUL, [Cornerstone Mutual Services](http://cornerstone.coop/), have got some kind of [Agency Banking](https://github.com/freerange/bank/wiki/Agency-banking-services) deal in place which means that each credit union can have its own sort code and gives them access to [things like Faster Payments, Direct Debits, etc](https://github.com/freerange/bank/wiki/Payment-mechanisms). I'm glad that there are now finally some signs of progress, although I really wish they were more transparent about it all. {by james-mead}

### [When TDD Doesn't Matter](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/when-tdd-doesnt-matter/797644973601702)

I found this article by Kent Beck really interesting. It reinforced to me how important it is to understand **why** you are using a particular practice like [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and not just [cargo-cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) it. {by james-mead}

### [Everyone Should Be Feeling the Customerâ€™s Pain](https://www.helpscout.net/blog/customer-pain/)

The idea of having everyone in your team do a stint on customer support is a really powerful one. It was something that our former client, [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/), really embraced and I certainly found my days on support very illuminating. {by james-mead}

### [Asking good questions is hard (but worth it)](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/08/31/asking-questions/)

This article by Julia Evans recognises that asking good questions is a skill in itself and is full of great advice on how to do it well. {by james-mead}

### [Testing XPath in Google Chrome and Firefox](https://afterthoughtsoftware.com/posts/Playing-with-XPath-in-Google-Chrome)

I had no idea that XPath selectors are built-in to Chrome's Developer Tools console - you just need to construct expressions like this: `$x("//div[@class='date']")`. Neat! {by james-mead}

Week 218
========

Why, hello there. I hope you’re all very well.

GFR were down to three this week as [James M](/james-mead) is taking a well deserved holiday. We weren’t lonely in the office though: We’ve been hosting a couple of special guests all week (more on this shortly) and [Tom Stuart](https://twitter.com/tomstuart) joined us for the first part of the week too. If you haven’t already, you should check out [Tom’s explanation](http://codon.com/building-a-govuk-exhibit) of the work he did to help demo [gov.uk](https://gov.uk) at the [Design Museum’s](http://designmuseum.org/) [Designs of the year 2013](http://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/2013/designs-of-the-year-2013) exhibition.

## Printers & prototypes

[James A](/james-adam)’s managed to cram quite a lot in during this week. Not only has he sent [printers](/printer) to the UK, the Netherlands and ‘stralia but he’s been busy getting everything in order for us to be able to send more at the drop of a hat. He’s also been experimenting with printing on labels, you know, if that’s your thing.

*Remember* If you’re interested in getting your hands on one of these splendid little kits, head over to our [printer kit page][printer-kit] and get your Paypal on.

While not spending time with Printer, James has been busy polishing up [heylist](/heylist). He’s taken our original proof of concept script and turned it into an actual thing that makes it easy for anyone to build a twitter list of conference goers. We’re not quite ready to take the covers off completely yet but you’ll be the first to know as soon as we are.

## Project Los Roques

This is all well and good, I hear you say, but what’s the deal with the special guests, and what on earth have you and [Tom](/tom-ward) been doing all week!? Alright, alright, I’ll tell you. Tom and I have spent the week working with a couple of people (M & J) that came to us with an idea but no money. It’s a bit of an experiment really, and we don’t know what will come of it but we’ve enjoyed the week and produced something that should allow M & J to take the concept further. I know this is all a bit secretive but you'll have to trust me when I say that we will go into more detail soon; probably early week when we've had some time to reflect.

And with that, I bid you all adieu and wish you all the very best of weekends.

### [Create Reminders in Google Search](http://googlesystem.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/create-reminders-in-google-search.html)

This is pretty neat. You can create Google Now reminders directly from the Google search box. Typing "Remind me to buy milk" will pop up the interface to allow you to create a reminder (although this only appears to work when I'm signed in to my personal Google account). {by chris-roos}


### [The New Google Alerts UI, Now Available](http://googlesystem.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/the-new-google-alerts-ui-now-available.html)

I kinda thought that Google Alerts had disappeared, but apparently not!

I've just had a quick play and ended up adding an alert for the [Credit Union Expansion Project][CUEP]. I've currently configured these alerts to be sent by email but I can imagine switching to receive them using RSS if they turn out to be too noisy. {by chris-roos}


### [Best Way To Pretty Print (Format) JSON On The Command-Line](http://www.skorks.com/2013/04/the-best-way-to-pretty-print-json-on-the-command-line/#yajltools)

I've just installed the YAJL tools so that I could reformat a pretty hefty JSON document in the terminal. TextMate 2 failed to reformat but the `json_reformat` command did the trick nicely. {by chris-roos}

Week 836
========

Week beginning Monday, 20th January 2025.

We spent most of the week working with our client, the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). We're still not able to share details of this project with you, but hopefully very soon. This week was the end of the first sprint, so we spent some time discussing how things are going so far and what to do next. We're really lucky to be working with a talented bunch of people on something important, but we're just getting to know each other - and remotely at that - so we're all making extra effort to talk, listen and understand each other.

There hasn't been much time to make progress on other things. James has spent a little time today working on [mocha](https://github.com/freerange/mocha) while Chris has been drafting a blog post about something he worked on towards the end of last year. I've been studiously avoiding the news.

Here's a few things from our #general channel:

- [travle.earth](https://travle.earth/) is a country-name guessing game.
- [The Co-operative Bank](https://www.thenews.coop/coventry-building-society-completes-takever-of-the-co-op-bank/) is a mutual again.
- Friend of the show [Tuzz](https://tuzz.tech) finished his [8-bit breadboard computer](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cpatuzzo_i-finished-building-my-8-bit-computer-activity-7280240747998502932-y3nP/).
- [DeArrow](https://dearrow.ajay.app/) crowd-sources better (i.e. less senstational and more accurate) titles and thumbnails for YouTube.

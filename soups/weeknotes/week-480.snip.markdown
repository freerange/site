Week 480
========

Howdi folks

[James][james-mead] is taking a well-earned break this week. [Chris][chris-lowis] and I have worked from [TOG][the-office-group] Whitechapel, TOG Bloomsbury and from home.

Looking at the office in Hoxton last week made us wonder what else was available. A friend suggested we look at [Ministry of Startups][ministry-of-startups]. We got in touch and were able to view a couple of their Whitechapel properties on Monday. The offices look just about perfect for what we're after and they're _very_ competitively priced so we're planning to take one on. We've notified TOG that we'd like to cancel our memberships.

We're coming to the end of our time on the [Asset Manager][asset-manager] project and have a final handover session arranged for Thursday next week. We ran the metadata update in production earlier this week but then suffered a number of setbacks that have further delayed us being able to switch to serving [Whitehall][whitehall] attachments from Asset Manager. We'll have to see how much we can do on Tuesday and Wednesday before the handover.

Chris published the [write-up of our Show & Tell event from last week][show-and-tell-42] as well as [weeknotes for last week][week-479].

Chris also helped get the [CoTech March newsletter][co-tech-newsletter] published.

I've ordered a laptop for our new member. He joins us on the 6th of April so we'll be able to share who it is next week.

Harmonia chose me to donate to charity this month and I chose [NCT][nct]. My partner and I are expecting our first child and have been making use of the great NCT classes available.

Until next time.

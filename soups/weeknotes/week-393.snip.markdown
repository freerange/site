Week 393
========

G'day folks,

There's been a distinct lack of week notes for the past 12 weeks (since week 380). We managed to miss a few weeks and then found that it became harder to motivate ourselves to write any at all. I'd like to think we'll fill in the gaps (some of them have already been written) but in the meantime I'm going to try to write about this week while it's fresh(ish) in my mind.

## Smart Answers

James and I finished working on Smart Answers on Thursday. Well, we mostly finished on Thursday although there are still a couple of things we've said we'll do before we properly finish. Thursday was our last day at Aviation House, though. Well, our last day for _now_ at least. It's possible we'll be back but there's nothing definite yet.

We spent most of our time either preparing for or taking part in a number of handover meetings with various people in the team. I really hope these have been useful. It's certainly the most time I've spent trying to hand things over when leaving a project.

We did manage to fit a little bit of development in amongst the various handover meetings. James managed to tidy up a spike of some work that should help the Content Designers work with Smart Answers. There was a positive response after demoing it last week so James was keen to finish it so that people could start using it. James also updated our regression test task so that it renders question pages as text instead of html. The content tools development team has recently been joined by a front end designer, Anika. Making this change should hopefully make Anika's life easier as she improves the neglected front end of Smart Answers.

I spent some time pairing with Pablo to finish some refactoring work we'd started on overseas-passports. We'd started the work a week or so ago so it was really good to get it finished before James and I left.

## GFR

We headed to the Seven Stars for our GFR monthly drinks on Wednesday. It was my first of 2016 (having only got back on the 1st July) and we had an enjoyable evening stood outside in the warm but sometimes wet weather.

I met Andrew again on Friday morning (previously in week 336). We've met a few times in the past and it was good to find out how they've been getting on. It's always interesting talking to Andrew as each time I seem to learn a little more about the fascinating world of the film industry.

I spent some time talking to our accountant, Paul, on Friday afternoon. We're still trying to get our annual accounts submitted. I was tasked with checking the accounts and couldn't quite understand where some of the figures had come from. Paul very patiently explained his motivation for their categorisation of the figures. Paul was particularly good at explaining things over the phone. It's not an easy skill but he's obviously practised and is very good at it.

I think that's about all for now. Let's see whether this helps unblocks our weeknote backlog!

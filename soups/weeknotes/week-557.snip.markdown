Week 557
========

Ben and I continue to work with [The Audience Agency][taa]. Chris and James with [FutureLearn][futurelearn] and Gregory on the Mission Patch game.

Having adopted and submitted our coop-compatible Articles of Association last week; we applied and were accepted as a member of [Coops UK][coops-uk] this week. We've been talking about and working towards this for a long time so I'm really pleased that we're finally here.

Ben and I kicked off the second Audience Agency sprint by shadowing some of the team to learn how they administer surveys and by using where we learnt to help us prioritise in sprint planning. We started to question whether we should be building new processes to ingest data or whether we should use the existing ingestion processes in the short term so that we can focus on user-facing features. We're currently leaning toward the latter.

Gregory continues to work on the game. The current plan is for him to spend week 558 tidying it up and then to spend the last two weeks of his internship working with us more closely on The Audience Agency project.

We collectively decided to take Friday off to join the [Climate Strike][climate-strike] on Millbank. I'm very happy that we are able to, and decided to, join the strike. It was incredible to see so many people out in support and to experience the festival-like atmosphere.

Until next time.

Week 254
========

Last Wednesday Chris & I decided that we'd be a bit lonely having our monthly drinks with just the two of us, so we decided to invite some long-term friends of [Go Free Range](/) along. We met up round the corner in the [Reliance](http://www.thereliancepub.co.uk/) and had a very jolly time. Thanks to everyone who came along!

Earlier that day we'd done some back-of-the-envelope calculations to try to make sense of our financial situation. It's been a bit hard to get a clear idea of where we stand what with the somewhat unknown liability of our office lease, etc. However, I now feel I have a much better handle on things. Indeed I think we were both pleasantly surprised by the healthiness of our financial affairs.

Work on [FutureLearn](http://futurelearn.com/) is ticking along nicely. [Chris](/chris-roos) and [Melinda](https://twitter.com/mseckington) spent quite a bit of time unpicking the idiosyncrasies of [ActiveRecord](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html) and ordering on `has_many :through` associations as the behaviour changed significantly from [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) v3 to v4.0.0 and again from v4.0.0 to v4.0.1.

Assuming we still have our office, we've decided to continue the tradition of having a [Christmas](http://lanyrd.com/2011/go-free-ranges-office-warmpocalypse/) [party](http://lanyrd.com/2012/go-free-range-christmas-mullfest/). So please keep the evening of Wednesday, 18th December free for mulled wine, mince pies and Christmas cheer [chez nous](http://lanyrd.com/venues/london/vkwy/). [Murray](https://twitter.com/hlame) has tried to persuade Chris to mull some eggs, but fortunately I'm not sure Chris was convinced.

Until next time,

-- James

Week 170
========

It's been another fairly quiet week at GFRHQ, with [James A][] out of the office on Monday and Tuesday and [Tom][] jetting off to Krakow on Wednesday for [Railsberry][] .

In [week-169][] James A touched on us losing sight of some of the larger goals we have as GFR.  I agree and wonder if we're being a bit extreme in our approach: previously, it was *all* about the client work, then it was *all* about discussing our future and just recently it's been *all* about going solo(ish) and working on whatever might interest us.  Although I've definitely enjoyed working on my toy bookmarking project and joining in with James A's excellent work on [Printer][] we need to make sure we do this while keeping the bigger picture in mind.  We should all be in the office next week so we'll pick up on it then.

## Printer

A few different things have happened in Printer land this week.  Not least of which is having 57 people say they'd be interested in buying a pre-configured kit of parts to build their own printer!  In order to meet demand, James A has spent quite some time investigating how we might buy these components in bulk.

James A and Printer have also made two fairly high profile appearances this week.  The first was at the [Internet of Things meetup 7][] and the second was in the Wired magazine article, "[Your Twitter Feed as Newspaper: A Look at the Tiny Printer Trend][]" by [Tim Maly][].  James has put an awful lot of work into this project so it's great that we're (yeah, that's right, *we're* :-)) getting this sort of coverage.

## Roosmarks

I finally gave in to [James M][]'s constant pressure and pushed the source of [roosmarks to github][].  I've also spent quite a bit of time getting the functionality and style to a point where it doesn't cause me too much pain in my day to day use.  You can see my copy of [roosmarks on heroku][] or follow the [instructions in the README][] to get your own copy up and running.  *NOTE* I'm not paying for roosmarks to be hosted on Heroku so every now and then a request will take some time to respond as it waits for the server process to boot.

I managed to lose about a day getting roosmarks running on my [FreeBSD][] VPS so that I can play around with remotely developing from my [Chromebook][] .

## P11Ds

These are a massive pain in the arse.  Fact.  Even though I'm almost 100% certain that us filling out P11Ds wouldn't change the amount of Tax or NICs we (as a company, or individually) pay, we're still supposed to complete them.  We'd originally planned to submit nil returns but then I spent a couple of hours reading the [A-Z list of Expenses and Benefits][] and started to get a little worried that we were intentionally mis-informing HMRC.  In the end we've asked our accountant ([Stuart Jones][] at [3CA][]) to complete them for us.  We've also spoken to Stuart about the possibility of working together to create a simple tool that might make P11D generation easier for [Free Agent][] users.  I have no idea whether there's any mileage in this but we'll see how it goes.

## Miscenanigans

James M took delivery of his [Rasberry Pi][] on Wednesday and promptly got it [set-up in the office][].  He initially installed a [Debian][] distro but I don't think that comes with Ruby so he's in the process of moving over to [Fedora][] .

Tom had a momentary bout of whachoo-doin-you-crazy-fool and got [stuck into some Java][], albeit with JRuby, at the beginning of the week.

James M took his HSBC dongle breaking as the sign he needed to go and buy a 70 piece toolkit from Maplins in order to poke around inside it.

James A might not be around but pointed out that the [bootstrapd][] conference might be something of interest.

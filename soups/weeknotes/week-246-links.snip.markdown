==================

[The Internet Failed](http://werd.io/2013/whoa-the-internet-failed-pcloud-indieweb)

This is a slide from the [Personal clouds meetup](https://personalclouds5.eventbrite.com/) ([original slides](http://www.slideshare.net/JohnBurnham1/pcloud)) that really resonates with me. It does feel as though we've reduced the Internet to a thing that allows us to connect to Google, Twitter, Facebook and all the other big players; rather than embracing its distributed nature to allow us all to connect as equals. {by chris-roos}


[How #xoxofest and #indiewebcamp saved me, in a way](http://werd.io/entry/5243114abed7de2970c0b2b7/how-xoxofest-and-indiewebcamp-saved-me-in-a-way)

I enjoyed reading this moving story of one person's struggle to re-find motivation to work on his own software. {by chris-roos}


[Lanyrd: from idea to exit - the story of our startup](http://blog.natbat.net/post/61658401806/lanyrd-from-idea-to-exit-the-story-of-our-startup?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email)

I had no idea that Natalie and Simon had started building Lanyrd while travelling the world. {by james-mead}


[A simple git branching model](https://gist.github.com/jbenet/ee6c9ac48068889b0912)

This is pretty close to how I prefer to develop -- at least it is if I _have_ to use feature branches -- and it's pretty close to how we're working at [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/). {by james-mead}


[To-Do Lists Don't Work](http://blogs.hbr.org/2012/01/to-do-lists-dont-work/)

While I agree with the problems outlined, I'm far from convinced using a calendar is the best solution. {by james-mead}

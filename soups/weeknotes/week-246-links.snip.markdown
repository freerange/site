[The Internet Failed](http://werd.io/2013/whoa-the-internet-failed-pcloud-indieweb)

This is a slide from the [Personal clouds meetup](https://personalclouds5.eventbrite.com/) ([original slides](http://www.slideshare.net/JohnBurnham1/pcloud)) that really resonates with me. It does feel as though we've reduced the Internet to a thing that allows us to connect to Google, Twitter, Facebook and all the other big players; rather than embracing its distributed nature to allow us all to connect as equals. {by chris-roos}


[How #xoxofest and #indiewebcamp saved me, in a way](http://werd.io/entry/5243114abed7de2970c0b2b7/how-xoxofest-and-indiewebcamp-saved-me-in-a-way)

I enjoyed reading this moving story of one person's struggle to re-find motivation to work on his own software. {by chris-roos}

### [Using CCMenu with Travis CI](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/cc-menu/)

I've used [CCMenu][] on Mac OSX for many years to keep an eye on continuous integration builds - it's a status bar app displaying a green or red symbol depending on the status of the build(s). Although it's somewhat old news, this article is a good write up of how to use CCMenu with [Travis CI][] for both public and private repositories. {by james-mead}


### [Using Feature Flags to Ship Changes with Confidence](http://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-03-04-use-feature-flags-to-ship-changes-with-confidence/)

Feature flags allow you to conditionally switch chunks of functionality on or off. They're commonly set on a per-environment or per-user basis. This tactic means a developer can commit work to `master` but hide the new functionality until it's "ready". This article gives some practical suggestions for how to implement feature flags in a Rails app. {by james-mead}

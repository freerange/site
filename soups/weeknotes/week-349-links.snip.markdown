Week 349 - Interesting links
============================

### [Utter Disregard for Git Commit History](http://zachholman.com/posts/git-commit-history/)

I found this interesting as I think it gives some insight into GitHub's preferred workflow which focuses much more on the pull request and much less on individual commits. {by chris-roos}


### [“Merge pull request” Considered Harmful](http://blog.spreedly.com/2014/06/24/merge-pull-request-considered-harmful/)

In contrast to the link above, one of the ActiveMerchant maintainers explains how he's moved away from using GitHub's "Merge pull request" button and toward using `git am` to apply the commits from a pull request. I find it interesting that he puts the commits straight into master rather than modifying them in a local branch and then merging that. {by chris-roos}


### [The git pickaxe](http://www.philandstuff.com/2014/02/09/git-pickaxe.html)

Phil explains how good commit messages make it possible to use the [git pickaxe][git-pickaxe] to efficiently find information about a line of code. I think this is really useful but it's something you can easily lose if you prioritise the pull request over individual commits (as suggested in Zach's post). {by chris-roos}


### [Lakeland 50 legend: Harry Johnson](http://www.montane.co.uk/news/montane-lakeland-100-50-lakelandlegend-harry-johnson)

A little inspirational link to finish with: Read an interview with 80 year old Harry who finished the [Lakeland 50][lakeland-50] race this year (50 miles of the Lake District taking in around 3000m of ascent). I love the support he receives as he comes over the finish line. {by chris-roos}

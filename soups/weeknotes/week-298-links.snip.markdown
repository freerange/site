### [Tunnels - HTTPS to HTTP proxy](https://github.com/jugyo/tunnels)

I've been using this to serve a local Rails app over SSL using [Pow][]. Browsers will complain about the certificate but it's good enough to ensure that we're not getting any mixed content problems. {by chris-roos}


### [New Interface for Google Takeout](http://googlesystem.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/new-interface-for-google-takeout.html)

I use the [Google Drive Client][] to ensure that I have copies of my Drive data stored on my laptop as well as online. That works great for regular files but not so well for native Drive files (e.g. Docs and Sheets) as the Client stores them as links rather than files containing the data.

To reduce the risk of losing potentially important information should I lose access to my Drive, I've also been using [Google Takeout][] to regularly backup the content of my Drive. This backup contains all native Drive files exported in Microsoft/Open Office compatible formats (docx and xlsx, for example).

This new version of Takeout allows you store the backup in Google Drive itself. Assuming you're running the Drive Client then the process of storing backups of all your Drive data just became a little bit easier. {by chris-roos}

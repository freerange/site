Week 879
========

Week beginning Monday, 17th November 2025.

We got together on Tuesday this week, starting with (an unnecessary second, in my case) breakfast on the South Bank before meeting with our friends at [Good Machine](https://www.goodmachine.team/) for lunch. [James D](https://abscond.org) had suggested we get in touch with them back in [week 877](/week-877) and we enjoyed sharing stories of our times at [GDS](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) and comparing notes on the current state of the industry, business development and so on.

We then decamped to [The Glad](https://www.thegladpub.co.uk/) to take a look at the rubyforge.org logs we've been gathering since [week 824](/week-824) and work out what to do next.

We spent most of the rest of the week working on [jam.coop](https://jam.coop). Jam has its own newsletter so [have a read of that](https://jam.coop/newsletters/5) if you'd like to know more about following, social media embeds and other new things.

## Things we've shared in our slack

Here's a few things we've shared in our slack channel this week:

- [Does AI-Assisted Coding Deliver? A Difference-in-Differences Study of Cursor's Impact on Software Projects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04427v2): I enjoyed reading about this statistical method, as I'd never heard of it. The upshot is adding Cursor to a project appears to cause the number of lines of code written to increase, which in turn appears to lead to more code complexity and bugs.
- [A visualization of satellites, debris, and other objects tracked by LeoLabs in low earth orbit](https://platform.leolabs.space/visualization)
- [Hollo](https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo): Federated single-user microblogging software.
- [OpenBenches 💖 OpenStreetMap](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/11/openbenches-%f0%9f%92%96-openstreetmap/): Terence Eden talks about the sharing of data between OpenBenches and OpenStreetMap. We couldn't agree more with "The joy of decentralised sites using open data is that we can all build on each others' work in a spirit of fun and exploration.".

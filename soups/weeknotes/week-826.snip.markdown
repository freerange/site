Week 826
========

Week beginning Monday, 11th November 2024.

[Chris][chris-lowis] and I started work on a new client project this week!
We've been asked to explore whether we can build a primarily-mobile [React][reactjs] app to simplify and improve an existing labour itensive, manual and error-prone process.
We've agreed on an initial budget of up to 24 days to come up with something that allows the client to decide whether it's worth them investing in the software.
If they decide it's worth the investment then it's possible there'll be some work to productionise it in early 2025.
We started on Tuesday and, after spending the first day meeting the team, have spent a good couple of days building.
I'm really happy with what we've achieved in a short period of time: the combination of pairing and utilising [Claude][claude]/[GitHub Copilot][github-copilot] means we've been able to get to a working prototype really quickly.
As James [mentioned last week](/week-825#:~:text=although%20nothing%20about%20the%20code%20was%20particularly%20complicated) these LLMs haven't (yet!) done anything that's outside our ability but they have allowed us to make progress quicker than if we were trying to do it using a more traditional approach: which gives us more time to focus on the features/UX that we really care about.

Our thanks to [James][james-mead] who stepped back to allow Chris and I to take this project on.
We recently noticed that our [individual pots](/week-825#individual-pots) have become a bit lopsided so having Chris and I work on this client project while James takes some time off should start to even things out a bit.
Thanks, James!

Hoping you have a good weekend.

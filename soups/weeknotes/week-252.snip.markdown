Week 252
========

Aloha my friends. I trust you're all well.

I think it's fair to say that the main news in GFR land was our [Exciting announcement](/some-exciting-news) earlier in the week. We've historically struggled with splitting our time between other people's projects and our own, and this is the latest way in which we're attempting to address that: [James A](http://lazyatom.com/) is going to head up [Exciting](http://exciting.io/) (and on [twitter](https://twitter.com/exciting_io)) which will have more of an emphasis on prototyping and developing products, while [James M](/james-mead) and [I](/chris-roos) will continue to run [Go Free Range](/) with more of an emphasis on being an excellent development partner.

We really appreciate all the work James A has put in to help make Go Free Range what it is today, and James M and I are looking forward to building on that in future.

On Wednesday, James and I visited [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), who are just round the corner from us[^office] on City Road. Being only vaguely aware of them, I found it really interesting to hear what they were up to and how they worked. Who knows, maybe we'll even find some future Free Rangers out of their programme.

Finally, we're going to finish the week celebrating one year(ish) of TAFKAIG[^tafkaig] and drinking beers with our [GDS](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/) chums. I hear we might even see an appearance by [T dub](https://tomafro.net/). I'm looking forward to it.

I hope you all have great weekends.

-- Chris

Week 828
========

Week beginning Monday, 25th November 2024.

We met on Monday at [Roast](https://roast-restaurant.com/) for an early Christmas lunch. Chris and I have been very busy with our current, short client project so it was great to take a breather and catch up with James. We rounded off the day, as is customary, with a pint - this time at the [Woolpack](https://www.woolpackbar.com/) in Bermondsey.

For the rest of the week Chris and I continued to work on the prototype/spike for our current client. It involves drawing using SVG so our experience building [Mission Patch](https://mission-patch.com) is coming in handy. There's also some fun algorithm-y challenges too which we don't get to use very often. We even thought that we might be able to use our friend [Tuzz's](https://tuzz.tech/) [Sentient](https://sentient-lang.org/) language to solve a layout problem, but we didn't have enough time or brains to work it out.

Although we're comfortable working in React and projects like this give us a chance to keep our eye in, we always want to make sure that it is indeed the right tool for the job. In this case, a site that must work offline, some kind of client side framework seems unavoidable. But I really enjoyed reading [Alex Russell's well-reasoned take](https://infrequently.org/2024/11/if-not-react-then-what/) on all of the situations where reducing client-side complexity is the best thing you can do.

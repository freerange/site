### [LightPaper for Mac](http://clockworkengine.com/lightpaper-mac/)

I came across this Markdown editor over Christmas and love it. I've tried [Mou](http://mouapp.com/) (which admittedly has a slightly different purpose) in the past but never really got into the habit of using it, while I'm already using LightPaper most days. One of the things I love about LightPaper is the ability of show a tree view of a folder structure (rather than being limited to opening a single file at a time.)

If you tend to write in markdown and use a Mac then it's definitely worth giving it a go. {by chris-roos}

### [Introducing Open Salaries at Buffer: Our Transparent Formula and All Individual Salaries](http://open.bufferapp.com/introducing-open-salaries-at-buffer-including-our-transparent-formula-and-all-individual-salaries/)

This is another one from the end of last year. I absolutely love this level of transparency at [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com/). Reading this reminds of some of the ways that I'd like to be more transparent about what we do/how we work at GFR. {by chris-roos}

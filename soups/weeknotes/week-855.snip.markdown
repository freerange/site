Week 855
========

Week beginning Monday, 2nd June 2025.

[Chris][chris-lowis] returned after enjoying a week's holiday with family and friends over half term.

It's been another busy week working on [Experience CS][experience-cs] with the [Raspberry Pi Foundation][rpf], mostly focussing on integrating the Scratch editor with [Code Editor for Education][cefe]. We've also been addressing feedback from the learning team now that they're starting to use it in anger, and [Seb][seb-jacobs]'s been doing a great job of making all the content translatable (not an easy task given that the content is spread across numerous apps and databases!)

Chris and I paired a bit this week which was great. We've felt some delivery pressure over the past few weeks which led us to work alone more often so this was a good reminder of the benefits of pairing.

We took a day off of the project yesterday to meet in person in Cambridge. We had a meeting in the Raspberry Pi offices in the morning and then spent the afternoon discussing GFR and generally catching up which was excellent.

Until next time...

-- Chris

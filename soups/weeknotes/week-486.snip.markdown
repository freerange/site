Week 486
========

This was a pretty quiet week with a bank holiday on Monday, Chris R being at home or off for most of the week, and Chris L and James taking Friday off.

We did a bit more on the project for BBC R&D - refactoring and adding a couple more example apps. And we continued with our business development efforts, knowing that the current project probably isn't going to last much longer.

That's all folks!

Monday Links
============

Here are a few links and ideas we've been thinking about over the last week. Hopefully this is something we can get going regularly.

### [http://glui.me/](http://glui.me/)

A simple alternative to [Skitch](http://evernote.com/skitch/), which was bought by Evernote and wandered in the feature wilderness for a while. I've used Skitch recently and it's not too bad, but this could be worth checking out.


### [Vagrant Providers](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/index.html)

Of course the main news is that you can [now use Vagrant with VMWare](http://www.vagrantup.com/vmware), but what I'm most interested in is the ability to [provision boxes "in the cloud"](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws). If I can run my tests on a serious compute unit that I only pay for when I need it, that could be really useful.

It's also going to be interesting to follow a company generating some revenue from open-source developer utility.


### [Printer Kit](/printer-kit)

Some shameless self-promotion, but if you're in the UK and want to build a [GFR Printer](/printer), it's never been easier.

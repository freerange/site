Monday Links - 218
============

Here are a few links and ideas we've been thinking about over the last week. Hopefully this is something we can get going regularly.


### [Glui](http://glui.me/)

A simple alternative to [Skitch](http://evernote.com/skitch/), which was bought by Evernote and wandered in the feature wilderness for a while. I've used Skitch recently and it's not too bad, but this could be worth checking out. {by james-adam}


### [The Joy of Clojure, Second Edition](http://www.manning.com/fogus2/)

A 2nd edition of the best book on Clojure I've read, 'The Joy of Clojure', is in the works.  You can get 50% off an early access copy using the code 'joycl2rh'. {by tom-ward}


### [Redline Smalltalk](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/redline-smalltalk-v1-0)

Since reading Kent Beck's "Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns", I've had a soft spot for Smalltalk, although I've never used it in anger. I recently backed this Indiegogo project to get Redline Smalltalk to v1.0. Redline is a Smalltalk for the JVM and the idea is to rejuvenate the Smalltalk community in the same way that Clojure has rejuvenated the Lisp community.  {by james-mead}


### [Vagrant Providers](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/index.html)

Of course the main news is that you can [now use Vagrant with VMWare](http://www.vagrantup.com/vmware), but what I'm most interested in is the ability to [provision boxes "in the cloud"](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws). If I can run my tests on a serious compute unit that I only pay for when I need it, that could be really useful.

It's also going to be interesting to follow a company generating some revenue from open-source developer utility. {by james-adam}


### [Santander 2013](http://potlatch.typepad.com/weblog/2013/03/santander-2013.html)

I thought this was a great piece of writing, putting into words the unsettling feelings I already had about this advert. {by tom-ward}


### [Printer Kit](/printer-kit)

Some shameless self-promotion, but if you're in the UK and want to build a [GFR Printer](/printer), it's never been easier. {by james-adam}


### [Syme: for real-time collaborating over SSH](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/clojure/BWDvfiidnlI)

Since I live a long way from our office in Shoreditch, I'm always interested in ways to make it easier to do remote pair programming. Syme looks like an interesting open-source project it's supposed to make it easy to set up disposable EC2 nodes for collaborating on GitHub projects via ssh and tmux. {by james-mead}


### [Design Museum Designs of the Year 2013](http://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/2013/designs-of-the-year-2013)

On Wednesday 20th the 'Designs of the Year 2013' opens at the design museum.  One of the nominees is gov.uk, for which we developed a large part of the Inside Government section.  Our friend and occasional office mate [Tom Stuart](http://codon.com) has developed a demo which shows the responsive design, letting you browse simultaneously on three several devices. {by tom-ward}


### [Huginn](https://github.com/cantino/huginn)

I'm quite intrigued by Huginn which claims to be a self-hosted mixture of Yahoo! Pipes plus IFTTT where you have a set of "agents" that monitor bits of the internet and act on your behalf based on a set of rules.  {by james-mead}

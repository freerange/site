Monday Links
============

Here are a few links and ideas we've been thinking about over the last week. Hopefully this is something we can get going regularly.

### [Glui](http://glui.me/)

A simple alternative to [Skitch](http://evernote.com/skitch/), which was bought by Evernote and wandered in the feature wilderness for a while. I've used Skitch recently and it's not too bad, but this could be worth checking out. {by james-adam}


### [Vagrant Providers](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/index.html)

Of course the main news is that you can [now use Vagrant with VMWare](http://www.vagrantup.com/vmware), but what I'm most interested in is the ability to [provision boxes "in the cloud"](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws). If I can run my tests on a serious compute unit that I only pay for when I need it, that could be really useful.

It's also going to be interesting to follow a company generating some revenue from open-source developer utility. {by james-adam}

### [The Joy of Clojure, Second Edition](http://www.manning.com/fogus2/)

A 2nd edition of the best book on Clojure I've read, 'The Joy of Clojure', is in the works.  You can get 50% off an early access copy using the code 'joycl2rh'. {by tom-ward}


### [Printer Kit](/printer-kit)

Some shameless self-promotion, but if you're in the UK and want to build a [GFR Printer](/printer), it's never been easier. {by james-adam}


### [Santander 2013](http://potlatch.typepad.com/weblog/2013/03/santander-2013.html)

I thought this was a great piece of writing, putting into words the unsettling feelings I already had about this advert. {by tom-ward}


### [Design Museum Designs of the Year 2013](http://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/2013/designs-of-the-year-2013)

On Wednesday 20th the 'Designs of the Year 2013' opens at the design museum.  One of the nominees is gov.uk, for which we developed a large part of the Inside Government section.  Our friend and occasional office mate [Tom Stuart](http://codon.com) has developed a demo which shows the responsive design, letting you browse simultaneously on three several devices. {by tom-ward}

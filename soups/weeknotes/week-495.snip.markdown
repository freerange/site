Week 495
========

My first week notes! Exciting. 

[Chris L][chris-lowis], [Chris R][chris-roos] and I have been at [Trainline][trainline] this week. [James][james-mead] is somewhere between [Lulworth and Minehead][south-west-coastal-path]. We think...

## Trainline

We've been figuring out how to make our mark as a team in a company used to employing individual contractors. So, I was very glad when, this week, we were given a short project that we can all work on together. 

It's a good project too, with real needs behind it, internal customers we can talk to and a bit of spelunking through their system to wire it all up.

One of the qualities I've always liked in GFR is, like good scouts, we have a determination to leave things a little better than we found them, to make the path for people following a little bit easier than it was for us. 

It was good to see us practise that this week by making and sharing a [VagrantFile][vagrant] that will make it easier for any contractors joining after us to get set up on Trainline's systems. 


## Other news

In other news, [Chris L][chris-lowis] hosted [LRUG][lrug] this week and  applied for a [DoS][dos] opportunity (for which we were rejected #sadface), [Chris R][chris-roos] has nearly finished the seating area on his [yacht][boatmaison], and I did some work to hopefully remediate a memory issue we're seeing on one of our heroku apps. 

Cheerio

Week 328
========

* Chris took Monday off after running in the [Shakespeare half-marathon][] in Stratford-upon-Avon at the weekend.

* Otherwise, we spent the bulk of the week working on-site on our client project. Having been in investigation mode for a while, it felt good to come up with a plan of action and to start putting it into practice.

* On Wednesday, we met up with a few folk for our monthly drinks at a new venue, the [Queen's Head][], just off Gray's Inn Road. As [Chris][] had promised, it had a good range of beer and we had a very pleasant evening with [Ben][], [Murray][], [Paul][] & [Tom][].

* We had Friday to ourselves at [GFRHQ][] where, amongst other things, we had a productive session going through our company Trello board.

* I spent a bit of time investigating having a public Google calendar for the Show & Tell events, but in the end we decided that the calendar feed from the [Lanyrd series][] was probably good enough. I then opened up the [Show & Tell mailing list][] so anyone can ask to join and members can view the archives. Finally I updated the [Show & Tell events page][] with all of this info.

* We decided to follow the crowd by moving our company chat room from [Campfire][] to [Slack][]. Before closing our Campfire account, I [archived the transcripts][campfire_export] which go back to January 2010.

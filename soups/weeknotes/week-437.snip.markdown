Week 437
========

All the public holidays seem to come at once in the UK - this Monday
was another one and with Chris R taking a break with his family in the
North of France, James and I spent most of the rest of the week in and
around the TOG offices at Kings Cross.

At Go Free Range we want to make sure everyone has control over the
decisions that are made and can fully participate in the decision
making process[^1]. One of the things that helps is making sure that
information is shared equally among the team. For example, we each
have full access to our company bank accounts
and [book keeping software](https://www.freeagent.com/) so we can see
when and how money is spent, what the current bank balances are and so
on.

When it comes to explaining expenses, invoicing clients, filing VAT
returns or running our payroll we randomly choose one person to be
responsible for making sure it gets
done. [Harmonia](https://harmonia.io) deals with the task allocation,
and a page in our internal wiki explains how to complete the task.

When we take time off, as Chris did this week, we mark ourselves as
"un-assignable" in Harmonia so that we can have an uninterrupted
break. The challenge when we return is making sure that we haven't
missed out on anything important that we might need to make
decisions. We've found a few ways of dealing with that:

- Break tasks into small pieces that can be completed frequently[^2]. That
  way it's likely that I'll soon be assigned the same task myself if
  I've been on leave. It's then easy to see what happened last time.
- Leave short notes when completing a task (we
  use [Trello](https://trello.com) for this). Most of the time these
  notes don't need to be read, but if I am looking for some context
  it's easy to catch up on what I've missed by reading those notes.
- Make tasks reproducible. By building up our shared wiki of
  instructions we have all contributed to the shared understanding of
  how something is done and it's less important to see the details
  each time a task is completed.
- Defer thornier issues for discussion. If something comes up and it
  can wait for a while we add it to a short "discussion" list in
  Trello. Later we can make a decision when we're all together.

## GFR

On Wednesday we held our monthly social event. We enjoyed a great
selection of food and jugs of Belgian beer
at [The Dovetail](http://dovepubs.com/aboutdovetail/) in
Clerkenwell. We also caught up for lunch with our
friends [Dan](https://twitter.com/pixelblend)
and [Chris](https://twitter.com/cpatuzzo).

## GDS

On Tuesday James and I went to Aviation House to catch up with Paul
about our progress on the Manuals Publisher project. We're starting to
reach the end of this phase of the work so we gave Paul an overview of
the progress so far and discussed the timings for the next phase with
him.

The Manuals Publisher app currently stores data locally and pushes it
to
the
[Publishing API](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api/). With
recent changes to how data moves between the applications at GDS,
storing data locally now isn't necessary. To wrap up the work on this
phase of the project we've decided to spend a couple of
days
[spiking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_(software_development))
a potential way of migrating the application to read data from the
publishing API rather than the local data store. Depending on the
timings for the next phase of the project and the outcomes of this
spike, we may decide to do this migration ourselves or help hand it
over to an internal team. We're planning to do this while also
gathering some information and researching our approach for the next
phase of the project.

Have a great weekend!

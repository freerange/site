Week 277
========

Suitably reinvigorated after the Bank Holiday, we resumed work on the [FutureLearn][] video project. [Chris][] got a fix in place for the annoying Internet Explorer web font problem and we made good progress on fixing a bunch of other browser-specific issues. By Friday we felt confident that the video player was in a good enough state so that we're now showing it to a subset of users. It feels _really_ good to have finally got something "live".

We've noticed that [James A][] over at [Exciting][] has been hard at work making improvements to [Harmonia][]. The new [calendar integration][] works really nicely. The way it adds `[DONE]` to the calendar event titles and cancels the alert is a nice touch. Although we don't really make use of it, I also like the way the calendar event attachments are displayed in Gmail. Keep up the good work, James!

On Wednesday, George from [GrantTree][] (just around the corner on Hewett Street) popped round to chat to us about R&D tax credits. It's useful to know a bit about how these work so that we can make use of them if and when we do some more work on our own products.

On Friday, Chris and I took half an hour out to watch the [Is TDD dead?][] hangout with Kent Beck, Martin Fowler and DHH. I'm not sure I got much out of it - it was a shame the discussion didn't involve a "mockist" TDD-er and I'd much prefer them to focus on some code examples rather than talking so much in the abstract.

Anyway, I'm finally up-to-date with the week notes. Huzzah!

### [Code Guide - Interactive Explanations of Example Code](http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000798.html)

This library allows you to embed tutorial documentation within source code using specially formatted comments. The source code and these special comments are converted into an interactive HTML tutorial which explains how the code works in a step-by-step manner. View [this example](http://natpryce.com/software/code-guide/example/selector-button-blink.html) and click the "Explain" button to see it in action. It was generated from this [source code](https://github.com/quick2wire/quick2wire-python-api/blob/master/examples/selector-button-blink). {by james-mead}


### [Fish Shell](http://fishshell.com/)

Pairing with new people always introduces new tools.  Last week working with [Nicky Thompson](http://symphonicknot.com) I saw she was using [fish](http://fishshell.com/) as her shell.  It looked great - things seemed to 'just work'.  I'm a long time ZSH user with [a few customisations](https://github.com/tomafro/dotfiles) but even so I'm tempted to switch. {by tom-ward}


### [BitTorrent Sync](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html)

We use [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) a lot at {gfr}, but cramming everything into that single directory can be a bit onerous. I've been experimenting with this as an alternative/augmentation, and currently have it syncing my 'Documents' and a few other directories from my laptop to one of my VPS machines "in the cloud". So far it works pretty well; the only problem is that most VPSes don't actually have a huge amount of disk space. {by james-adam}

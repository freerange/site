### [Code Guide - Interactive Explanations of Example Code](http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000798.html)

This library allows you to embed tutorial documentation within source code using specially formatted comments. The source code and these special comments are converted into an interactive HTML tutorial which explains how the code works in a step-by-step manner. View [this example](http://natpryce.com/software/code-guide/example/selector-button-blink.html) and click the "Explain" button to see it in action. It was generated from this [source code](https://github.com/quick2wire/quick2wire-python-api/blob/master/examples/selector-button-blink). {by james-mead}


### [Fish Shell](http://fishshell.com/)

Pairing with new people always introduces new tools.  Last week working with [Nicky Thompson](http://symphonicknot.com) I saw she was using [fish](http://fishshell.com/) as her shell.  It looked great - things seemed to 'just work'.  I'm a long time ZSH user with [a few customisations](https://github.com/tomafro/dotfiles) but even so I'm tempted to switch. {by tom-ward}


### [BitTorrent Sync](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html)

We use [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) a lot at {gfr}, but cramming everything into that single directory can be a bit onerous. I've been experimenting with this as an alternative/augmentation, and currently have it syncing my 'Documents' and a few other directories from my laptop to one of my VPS machines "in the cloud". So far it works pretty well; the only problem is that most VPSes don't actually have a huge amount of disk space. {by james-adam}


### [Anatomy of a zero-knowledge web application](https://www.clipperz.com/blog/2007/08/24/anatomy_zero_knowledge_web_application/)

With the news that the [NSA can access your online data whenever they feel like it](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data), it was interesting to read how the developers of the [Clipperz on-line password manager](https://www.clipperz.com/) have built a web application that claims to know *nothing* about their users or their data. I'm not sure how realistic it is for every application, but I did wonder whether it might suggest a way to provide a hosted version of Chris' excellent [MoneyTracker](https://github.com/chrisroos/money-tracker) app. {by james-mead}

### [Experiments with Strengthening JavaScript](https://developers.google.com/v8/experiments)

The Chrome V8 team have been exploring some ways to mitigate post-ES6 performance and usability issues, including a [Strong Mode](https://developers.google.com/v8/experiments#strong) for the language and an optional type system, [SoundScript](https://developers.google.com/v8/experiments#sound). {by james-mead}


### [Gogs](https://try.gogs.io/)

A painless self-hosted Git service written in Go. I seem to remember spending ages trying to set up my own Git server ages ago. This looks as if it might've made life a bit easier. {by james-mead}


### [Computers in Spaceflight: The NASA Experience](http://history.nasa.gov/computers/contents.html)

I came to this while reading about [Voyager's computer system](http://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch6-2.html). I was particularly fascinated by some of the failure recovery stories, e.g.

> When the backup came on-line it had no record of the gyro readings. Not knowing how bad things were was a blessing, as it executed a simple orientation and stopped the spacecraft roll.

Interesting stuff! {by james-mead}


### [Nokia 5110 Graphic LCD 84x48](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10168)

[Ben G](https://twitter.com/beng) recommended this as a nice cheap display for a Raspberry Pi. I've just bought [one from Hobbytronics](http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/lcd/nokia-5110-lcd) for the princely sum of Â£7.00 to incorporate into my SDR/AIS project. Now I just need to work out how to wire it up. {by james-mead}


### [Democracy Club CVs](http://cv.democracyclub.org.uk/)

Francis Irving is [aiming to collect the Curriculum Vitae of everyone standing for parliament](http://www.flourish.org/2015/03/why-im-collecting-every-mp-candidates-cv/) which seems like a very worthwile project. {by james-mead}

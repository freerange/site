Week 290 - Interesting links
============================

### [How science can beat the flawed metric that rules it](https://theconversation.com/how-science-can-beat-the-flawed-metric-that-rules-it-29606)

The [Impact Factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor) of an academic journal is increasingly being used as a shortcut to assessing the scientific merit of individual papers and thereby individual scientists. Many scientists I know complain that it's often a very unfair metric, but I think this article is right in saying that the only way to improve matters is to come up with better metrics. {by james-mead}


### [Wuthering Bytes](http://wutheringbytes.com/)

This looks like a really interesting conference, but unfortunately I'm going to be away when it's on. I wish I'd read about it sooner. {by james-mead}


### [The impact of GitHub on Open Science](https://twitter.com/jnuneziglesias/status/494985619798368259/)

This link is to a tweet containing a photo of a slide presented at [PyCon Australia](http://2014.pycon-au.org/). Unfortunately I couldn't find a better source. However, it shows a graph of the cumulative author counts over time for [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) & [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/). There's a clear jump which I assume coincides with the point when the projects moved onto [GitHub](https://github.com/). {by james-mead}


### [Introducing Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/blog/introducing-stellar/)

Stripe recently wrote about [their perspective on Bitcoin](https://stripe.com/blog/bitcoin-the-stripe-perspective) and they talked a lot about the idea of _gateways_ which "should allow people to transparently get into and out of the network, while always thinking in terms of their normal currency".

Stellar is an open-source project which provides a "decentralized protocol for sending and receiving money in any pair of currencies" which should make it a lot easier to build such _gateways_. {by james-mead}


### [Eurucamp 2014 Podcast](http://2014.eurucamp.org/podcast/#TCC003)

In this podcast, [Tom Stuart](http://codon.com/) chats about his [Introduction to Monads](http://2014.eurucamp.org/speakers/#tom-stuart) conference talk and "a lot of other things including the problems with math education". Via [James Coglan](http://jcoglan.com/). {by james-mead}


### [Eastbourne pier fire - drone footage](https://vimeo.com/102174078)

This 5 minute video has some incredible footage of the recent fire on Eastbourne pier. I'm amazed that you can get this sort of quality from a drone and camera _relatively_ cheaply. Via [Tom S](http://codon.com). {by chris-roos}


### [Google Cardboard](https://developers.google.com/cardboard/)

I thought it was a joke when someone told me about Google Cardboard. Having watched the [Google I/O video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFog2gMnm44) I realised it was indeed real and decided to have a go at building one. I ordered some [components from Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/AM-CARDBOARD%C2%AE-Complete-Cardboard-Project/dp/B00LM36DUK), bought some card from Ryman's and got cutting. It probably took around 3 hours to put everything together but I think it's turned out quite well. {by chris-roos}


### [When Workers Own Their Companies, Everyone Wins](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118933/economic-benefits-coop)

Although it's a bit US-centric, I found this article about the economic benefits of worker cooperatives interesting. Via [Chris Lowis](http://chrislowis.co.uk/). {by james-mead}

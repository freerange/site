Week 290 - Interesting links
============================

### [How science can beat the flawed metric that rules it](https://theconversation.com/how-science-can-beat-the-flawed-metric-that-rules-it-29606)

The [Impact Factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor) of an academic journal is increasingly being used as a shortcut to assessing the scientific merit of individual papers and thereby individual scientists. Many scientists I know complain that it's often a very unfair metric, but I think this article is right in saying that the only way to improve matters is to come up with better metrics. {by james-mead}


### [When 'exciting' trumps 'honest', traditional academic journals encourage bad science](https://theconversation.com/when-exciting-trumps-honest-traditional-academic-journals-encourage-bad-science-29804)

I suspect that scientists are "sexing up" their papers more often than people think, because of the pressure to publish in high-impact journals. This article makes a compelling argument that we should find a way to "publish more papers, even boring ones". I think Robert is also right in saying:

> The main objection to this is that the resulting morass of published articles [would be tough to sort through](https://theconversation.com/how-science-can-beat-the-flawed-metric-that-rules-it-29606). But this is the internet age. We have become [past masters at sorting through masses of crap to get to the good stuff](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/) â€“ the internet itself would be unusable if we weren't.

### [Wuthering Bytes](http://wutheringbytes.com/)

This looks like a really interesting conference, but unfortunately I'm going to be away when it's on. I wish I'd read about it sooner. {by james-mead}


### [The impact of GitHub on Open Science](https://twitter.com/jnuneziglesias/status/494985619798368259/)

This link is to a tweet containing a photo of a slide presented at [PyCon Australia](http://2014.pycon-au.org/). Unfortunately I couldn't find a better source. However, it shows a graph of the cumulative author counts over time for [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) & [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/). There's a clear jump which I assume coincides with the point when the projects moved onto [GitHub](https://github.com/). {by james-mead}


### [Introducing Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/blog/introducing-stellar/)

Stripe recently wrote about [their perspective on Bitcoin](https://stripe.com/blog/bitcoin-the-stripe-perspective) and they talked a lot about the idea of "gateways" which "should allow people to transparently get into and out of the network, while always thinking in terms of their normal currency".

Stellar is an open-source project which provides a "decentralized protocol for sending and receiving money in any pair of currencies" which should make it a lot easier to build such "gateways". {by james-mead}


### [Eurucamp 2014 Podcast](http://2014.eurucamp.org/podcast/#TCC003)

In this podcast, [Tom Stuart](http://codon.com/) talks about his [Introduction to Monads conference talk](http://2014.eurucamp.org/speakers/#tom-stuart) and "a lot of other things including the problems with math education". Via [James Coglan](http://jcoglan.com/). {by james-mead}

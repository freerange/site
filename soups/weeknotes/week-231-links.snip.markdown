###[IndieAuth: Sign in with your domain name](https://indieauth.com/)

I came to this by way of this [write up of the login experience](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2013/06/07/Why-findIDP) on [Poetica](https://poetica.com/). This in turn lead me to Blaine's article about [Fixing Sign-in](http://blog.romeda.org/2013/06/thoughts-on-signin.html) which mentioned IndieAuth as a better alternative to [OpenID](http://openid.net/). IndieAuth describes itself as "a way to use your own domain name to sign in to websites" and "part of the Indie Web movement to take back control of your online identity".

I added some `rel="me"` links to [my personal website](http://jamesmead.org) and gave it a try. It worked successfully and very smoothly with Github and Google+, but I ran into problems with Twitter and Flickr. IndieAuth didn't seem to be able to detect the link back to my website from my Twitter profile and I ended up getting a nasty error during the login via Flickr. Anyway, it looks like a promising idea and something that I'd like to consider for a GFR project in the future. {by james-mead}

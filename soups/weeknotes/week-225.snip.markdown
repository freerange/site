Week 225
========

I'm afraid this week's notes are going to be short and sweet, because I haven't been anywhere near as organised as I was last week.

We're continuing to beaver away on [FutureLearn](http://futurelearn.com). We had a good "show-and-tell" at the end of last week -- it was good to get positive feedback from the project stakeholders.

We're working on two-week sprints for this project and this week is the 1st half of a new sprint. We're more used to working on one-week iterations and so it's been interesting to try a different approach. With the two-week sprints it's possible to spend more time doing things like the planning game and a thorough "show-and-tell", but I do wonder whether the extra "ceremony" is as efficient in the longer term.

The perennial question of how to organise our tests, particularly [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) acceptance tests, has reared its head again this week. I know I struggle with the lack of constraints when writing Cucumber scenarios. I feel that the lack of constraints means that it's all too easy for each developer in a team to take different approaches and to end up with a real muddle.

I may have remembered this incorrectly, but I'm pretty sure [James](/james-adam) has previously told me that it's this very lack of constraints that he _likes_, because it tends to ensure that his test is not coupled to the implementation. Although I do agree, I'd still like to find a good set of patterns/rules for writing & organising scenarios. I've been doing quite a bit of thinking about it this week, so I probably ought to try to write up my thoughts in a bit more detail at some point.

Anyway, our most important bit of news is that [Tom became a father](https://twitter.com/tomafro/status/331102953182203904) over the bank holiday weekend. Many, many congratulations to him and his other half, and welcome to Frederick!

Have a great weekend, everyone.

-- James.

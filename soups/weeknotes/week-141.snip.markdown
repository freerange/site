Week 141
========

Big news this week: we now have an office.  It's been a (very) long process, but on Thursday we finally signed a lease on some space in Worship Street.  It's great to have a new home.  We'll be sure to invite you all around when we move in.  

I say when, because at the moment we're all working with the Gov UK team in Lambeth.  Our new office may lie empty for a while.  

It was my first week working with the team, and I'm really impressed with how much has been achieved.  We've built a small platform to publish various bits of government information, with a simple workflow and fact-checking facilities baked right in.  In the next sprint we'll build on this, adding more knowledge about the structure of government.  That's when things become really interesting.  Remember, you can [follow along at home](http://github.com/alphagov/whitehall).

One advantage of being based in Lambeth is that we get to watch the other Gov UK team members at work.  The whole office has a real buzz; a feeling that everyone's contributing to something significant.

### Jase in Sofia

While most of us have been toiling in Lambeth, [Jason](/jason-cale) took his trip to Sofia to speak at [DesignDay 2011](http://designday.netmag.bg/).  His talk went well, but his attempts to follow a vegan diet faltered.  

### Miscellany ###

Other bits and pieces include the fact that [James Adam](/james-adam) is making one of his regular visits to Austin, Texas.  He'll be working whilst away; our challenge is to keep working as a team despite the time-zone mismatch.  We're not great at it yet, but we're determined to get better.

Finally, I and other members of the team are busy working on our [LRUG](http://lrug.org/) Battleship programs.  If you want to challenge us, there's about a week left to write yourself a player.  You'd better hope that [Paul](http://po-ru.com/) has implemented some strict security counter measures, because like all good Generals, I intend to cheat.  Remember, all's fair in love and war.

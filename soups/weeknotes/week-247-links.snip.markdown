[Remote Debugging on Android](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging)

It turns out that it's pretty trivial to remote debug web pages (using Chrome's web inspector) on an Android device with this Chrome extension. If you've ever used Safari to remote debug connected iOS devices, then you'll be right at home with this. {by chris-roos}


[Enable HiDPI mode in Mountain Lion w/o Quartz Debug](https://gist.github.com/simX/3191869)

I've successfully used this little technique to emulate a retina display on my 13" Macbook Air. It's not the most usable thing in the world as I get a scaled resolution of 720 x 450, but it was good enough to let me test some retina icons. {by chris-roos}


[Sea Change: High and Low Tide](http://imgur.com/a/BoKu6)

I love these little two frame animations that show the difference between high and low tide at various locations. It's given me ideas about automatically generating simple animations of some of the [images I'm collecting](http://thames-time-lapse.chrisroos.co.uk/). {by chris-roos}

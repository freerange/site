### [IMVU’s Approach to Integrating Quality Assurance with Continuous Deployment](http://engineering.imvu.com/2010/04/09/imvus-approach-to-integrating-quality-assurance-with-continuous-deployment/)

[Tom](/tom-ward) gave a great presentation at [FutureLearn](http://futurelearn.com) last week about the business case behind continuous deployment. Following on from that I enjoyed reading this (admittedly old) article about how the lean-startup gurus think about quality and QA. This paragraph stood out:

> We’ve found that the costs we incur -- typically bugs or unpolished but functional features -- are worthwhile in the name of getting feedback from our customers as quickly as possible about our product innovations. The sooner we have feedback from our customers, the sooner we know whether we guessed right about our product decisions and the sooner we can choose to either change course or double down on a winning idea.

Striking a balance between polishing features and shipping them fast is a tough problem, but one worth perfecting. {by james-mead}


### [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io)

Work through exercises in a handful of different languages, and get feedback from other people who've worked through the same exercise. I've been using this for the past week, and it's been quite fun to see what people think about little bits of code. I'm *slightly* concerned that it will lead to a mono-culture of "best practices", and I see the same feedback about certain techniques handed down from person to person, but I still think there's definitely merit in the idea. {by james-adam}


### [Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io)

A hosted pairing development system; basically it spins up a VPS instance and lets you easily SSH into it, edit files using a local editor (syncing the files up to the VPS) or a web-based one, and then run your app in development mode on the VPS. Pretty neat, although I really don't like the colour scheme :) {by james-adam}

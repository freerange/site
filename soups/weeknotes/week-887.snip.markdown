Week 887
========

Week beginning Monday, 12th January 2026.

I was off sick early in the week with an unpleasant bout of 'flu, so I really appreciated [Chris L] and [Chris R] holding the fort.

## Government Digital Service 🏷️

This week we've continued our work at [GDS] to dig into the tagging workflow used in [GOV.UK Publishing]. [Becky] & [Adam] have run a bunch of research sessions with users of the GOV.UK Publishing system. We've taken it in turns to sit in on these sessions and they've been very illuminating.

## Jam 🍓

Last Friday Chris L & Chris R met up with [Nicola] in person near Old Street. It sounds like this was a really useful meeting - Nicola has a lot of experience in the music industry and shares our desire to make it more equitable for independent artists.

A while ago we found Sprint Law's [article about the Payment Services Directive v2][psd2-article] and Chris R has spoken to one of their lawyers about how we can make sure [Jam] is compliant. It turns out their expertise is more on the legal side of things than on the tax side, but it was a useful discussion nonetheless.

Earlier today we all had a video call with [Lydia] at [pom pom publishing] who sell digital books & magazines of knitting patterns. It was interesting to hear how they license these and distribute royalties to the authors. And we've just come off a follow-up workshop with Polly at [Newable] about how to move things forward with Jam - as always this was really helpful!

## Miscellaneous 🧩

Chris L and I have both had building work going on this week which has been a bit disruptive and Chris L and Chris R have both had to contend with extra childcare duties.

Apparently it was GFR's 17th birthday on Thursday which slightly blows my mind - I don't know where all the time's gone! We should try to mark the occasion somehow!

Until next time.

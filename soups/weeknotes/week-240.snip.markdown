Week 240
========

This week, GFR have mostly been programming in Rails.

Ha, {l week-239, reference humour}!

Its still basically true, but GFR in this case has mostly been Chris and myself; Tom has left for Canada for two and a half weeks, and James M has also been on holiday. FutureLearn are getting ready to push into a proper public alpha/beta, and so much of the effort has been in tidying up the miscellany via shorter user stories.

There is, unfortunately, nothing terribly interesting to report beyond that, at least not yet. Some other things are brewing at a slow pace behind the scenes, but nothing is quite ready for public consumption.

As you were,

-- James

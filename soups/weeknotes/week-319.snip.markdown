Week 319
========

At the beginning of the week we were both decompressing a bit and catching up with admin. We both had a few bits of work-in-progress left over from FutureLearn and so we spent an hour or two crafting it all into pull requests, gists and emails.

I then made a start on writing up the [week notes][], but got side-tracked into moving one of our internal wiki pages [onto our public site][]. The CSS on our site is a bit unloved, so this took a bit longer than I intended. However, we are planning to publish as much of our internal wiki as we sensibly can -- we'd like to be as open as possible about how our company works.

Meanwhile [Chris][] made a start on our weekly book-keeping task. This was trickier than usual, because we needed to explain the *partial* return of the deposit relating to our old Worship Street office.

## Nand2Tetris

On Tuesday evening, I went to a [meeting of the London Computation Club][] in which we successfully implemented an assembler for the Hack assembly language which is designed to run on the Hack hardware platform that we "wired up" in the previous meeting.

We've taken to working through the exercises as a group on the projector with one person "driving". This seems to work much better when we use a test-driven approach, because it helps keep us all focussed on the same thing.

## Office Hunt

We were out and about for all of Wednesday, meeting potential clients and viewing possible desk/office space. After a meeting, we had a quick look around [The Office Group][] in Marylebone and then headed to the [café at the British Library][BL cafe] for lunch and a bit of a chat about our plans for the rest of the year.

We then dropped into the [Kings Cross Impact Hub][] and the [Islington Impact Hub][] as we made our way eastwards towards Shoreditch. We hadn't appreciated that both these places are run as franchises and so there's a really different feel to each one. Lee, the Community Host at the Islington one, was particularly welcoming, especially given we'd just turned up on spec.

[Techspace][] and [TechHub][] were right at the other end of the spectrum. Techspace doesn't have anyone on-site to chat to drop-ins (at least not in their Bath St office). And even though TechHub (Old St) has a staffed reception, you need to make an appointment to view the office and even then you have to "prove" you are a company developing a "product". It's probably silly of me, but the formality of both organisations really put me off.

We then ended up at Google's [Campus London][] for a well-earned cup of tea, although we had to slum it on one of the picnic tables in the courtyard which got a bit chilly after a while -- apparently the desks here fill up soon after 9am when it opens. Chris booked us in for a few more viewings while I interjected with unhelpful comments from the sidelines.

## Beer

After an early & delicious dinner at the [Book Club][], we headed to the [Wenlock Arms][] for our monthly jolly. This was our first visit to this pub, but it turns out that it has a fine array of cask ales. [Dark Star][]'s Hophead and American Pale Ale were popular choices and [Camden Hells Lager][] kept Chris R happy. Anyway, a good time was had by all, although I believe there were a few sore heads the next morning.

## More Viewings

On Thursday morning, Chris and I were up relatively early to visit [Sidekick Studios][] where there were a couple of desks available to rent -- they have a very nice space on City Road just north of the Old Street roundabout. We went straight on from there to a viewing at the smart-looking [Central Working][] offices next door to Campus London. They offer everything from co-working to serviced offices and it was good to get a feel for the prices of all these different options.

* Failed attempts at Campus London & the [Dolcezza Café][] (associated with Central Working)
* Brunch at Lantana? Did we go to Hoxton Hotel first?
* Chris kept his birthday a secret.

## Friday

* I played with RTL SDR dongle, GQRX, Gnu Radio, etc.
* Chris gave MoneyTracker some love including merging my 11 month old PRs and upgrading to the latest Rails.

### [The First Federated #Indieweb Comment Thread](http://tantek.com/2013/113/b1/first-federated-indieweb-comment-thread)

Posting content on my own site (or using my preferred service) and having that content notify/appear on the site I'm mentioning is something I've been thinking about for years. Way back when, I even spent some time [modifying the delicious firefox plugin to send trackbacks to the sites I was bookmarking](http://chrisroos.co.uk/blog/2008-02-04-sending-trackbacks-to-the-sites-that-you-bookmark-in-del-icio-us). Hopefully I'll find some time to add similar functionality to [Roosmarks](https://github.com/chrisroos/roosmarks) in the near future. {by chris-roos}

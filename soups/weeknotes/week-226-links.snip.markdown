### [How we used email as a customer support system at mySociety](http://www.flourish.org/blog/?p=921)

Initially we used an email address as the support mechanism for [Harmonia](https://harmonia.io), but after a while we decided to use  [Intercom](https://www.intercom.io). I found it interesting to read how [mySociety](http://www.mysociety.org/) used email filters and human discipline to tackle some of the same problems that Intercom and other similar products solve. This also plays into our internal discussion about using [Google Groups as a Collaborative Inbox](http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en-uk&hlrm=en&answer=167430) to handle incoming company email. {by james-mead}


### [A Womanâ€™s Place](https://medium.com/everything-old-is-new-again/8c5883a005c3)

I enjoyed reading this story about a company, "F International", which in the 1960s recognized the potential of mothers with young children to be remote freelance programmers. It's rather sad that the company gradually lost it's original very healthy culture as it grew, but as far as I can see this tends to be the almost inevitable outcome of rapid growth. And as the [author](https://medium.com/@Jn_Norris) notes, "it seems remarkable that the same industry is still fumbling with the issue of gender equality". {by james-mead}

### [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun)

With our current work on [FutureLearn](http://futurelearn.com/), I've been keeping an eye out for interesting [MOOCs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course). A former colleague, [Ivan Moore](https://twitter.com/ivanrmoore), and a recent acquaintance, [Rob Chatley](https://twitter.com/rchatley), have both been working their way through Martin Odersky's [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) MOOC. Given their positive comments and the fact that Martin designed the [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) programming language, it sounds like a very worthwhile challenge.

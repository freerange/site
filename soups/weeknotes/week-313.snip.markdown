Week 313
========

This week was a bit sad, because it was the last week we had our office at 87 Worship Street in Shoreditch -- the lease came to an end on Sunday. As you may have read in previous week notes, the landlord has [almost doubled the rent][gfrhq-property-details] and we can't justify paying that much, so we've reluctantly decided to move out.

### Computation Club

Before moving out we hosted one last edition of the [London Computation Club][]. This week [we worked through the exercises in chapter 4][nand2tetris-chapter-4] of Elements of Computing Systems which involved writing a couple of small programs in the eclectic _HACK_ assembly language. I thoroughly enjoyed the evening and I'm looking forward to the next meeting which will be hosted by [Leo Cassarini][] at [Geckoboard][].

### Down Under

[Chris][] is now on the New Zealand leg of his Antipodean adventure and it looks as if he & Amy are having a lot of fun!

### Moving Out

I spent all week in the office (i.e. not at [FutureLearn][]) preparing for the move -- administrivia, disassembling furniture, packing, cleaning, etc. On Wednesday morning [Hackney Council][] took away the older chairs and desks that we inherited from the previous tenants and later that day the [British Heart Foundation][] collected a couple of sofas that were surplus to requirements.

I managed to get everything packed up in the nick of time for [Rocket Van][] to move the rest of our stuff into our [Urban Locker][] self-storage unit on Thursday and luckily everything fitted in OK. Thanks to [Tom S][] and [Tom T][] for their help and forbearance all week and thanks to [James A][] who helped out on the day of the move.

I spent the rest of Thursday getting the place cleaned up and handed the keys over to the landlord on Friday morning.

### Kalv

[Kalv][], a GFR alumnus, was in town on Friday and a group of us met up with him for a very enjoyable lunch at the [Strongroom Bar & Kitchen][] -- Kalv [emigrated to Vancouver][] in Canada back in 2011. It was really interesting to hear about his experiences of looking for funding for a JavaScript analytics product, [Caliper][], and subsequently of setting up and running the successful company, [Brewhouse Software][].

### Prospect

Later on Friday I headed over to Fitzrovia to meet a prospective client. I'd be the first to admit that "sales" is not one of my strong points, so I was a little apprehensive about going to this meeting on my own. However, the people were very friendly and I hope I did a reasonable job of explaining how GFR works and why we choose to work that way.

That's all folks.

Week 422
========

_Note that I'm writing these notes about 4 months late which is why they're in summary form._

* James and I documented our research into [Manuals Publisher][manuals-publisher] along with a number of possible next steps.

* Met Jen, Tim and Paul on Wednesday to present our suggestions for Manuals Publisher. We recommended refactoring the app given that the biggest problem seems to be that it's so hard for developers to work on.

* Ordered a laptop for [Chris L][chris-lowis] in preparation for him joining us next week.

* Arranged an extra membership of [The Office Group][the-office-group] for Chris L.

* Continued using [Cobudget][cobudget] to crowdfund the bar tab for the [CoTech][co-tech] social during Open:2017.

* Attended the [Open 2017][open-2017] conference at [Goldsmiths][goldsmiths] on Thursday and Friday.

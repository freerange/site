Week 248
========

Last week was our first week without [Tom](/tom-ward). I want to thank him for his kind words in [last week's notes](/week-247) and reciprocate by saying that I've learnt a lot working with him over the last few years -- he's been a real asset to [GFR](/). We're definitely going to miss having him around, but we're glad he's still going to be based in London -- hopefully we can still hang out with him from time to time -- and we wish him all the best in his new job.

[Chris](/chris-roos) also deserted me last week -- he spent the week in Austin, Texas, accompanying his partner, [Amy](https://twitter.com/amyeee), and her friend, [Emily](https://twitter.com/ewebber), who were out there researching for their [Minimum Viable Book](http://minimumviablebook.com/) project. Fortuitously, since [James A](/james-adam) is based in Austin, the two of them were able to meet up and sample the delights of the Austin [coffee](http://www.houndstoothcoffee.com/) [shop](http://www.jpsjava.com/) [scene](http://www.epochcoffee.com/).

Otherwise, work on [FutureLearn](http://futurelearn.com) continues apace. Last week was the first week of the first "proper" course -- [The Secret Power of Brands](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/secret-power-of-brands-2014), run by the [University of East Anglia](http://www.uea.ac.uk/). In related news, a couple of interesting articles have appeared on the FutureLearn blog in recent weeks: [Continuous Delivery at FutureLearn](http://about.futurelearn.com/blog/a-continuous-delivery/) by [Tom](/tom-ward) following on from the talk which I mentioned in the [links for week 237](/week-237-links), and [What is Beta?](http://about.futurelearn.com/blog/what-is-beta/) by our product owner, [Matt Walton](http://mattwalton.co.uk/).

In the middle of next week I'm off to Spain by train for a few days cycling in Catalonia. I'm hoping the weather there is going to be sunny, but not too hot. Anyway, enjoy what's left of the weekend and have a good week next week.

-- James.

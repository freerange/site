Week 498
========

We're into holiday season this week, both at GFR and at our current client The Trainline so we've been careful to do some extra planning to make sure we've got plenty to work on.

On Monday we attended the planning and retrospective sessions for the two teams we've been working with - it was interesting to see how these run and I think we were able to make some positive contributions.

We're continuing with the project we started a couple of weeks ago - it's a little bit fiddlier than we'd anticipated but we're also taking opportunities to tidy up and refactor some code as we go to make the changes we want to make easier. Changes have to go through a slightly lengthier code-review process than we're used to, but we're hopeful we'll be able to get the first version of the feature we've been working on deployed next week.

We had a useful meeting on Wednesday with a potential future client and we're taking a bit of time today to catch up on some company admin. I noticed today that its now over a year since we started [making regular donations to charity](http://gofreerange.com/week-433) - in the past year we've made 12 donations to charities such as Great Ormond Street and the [Rushey Green Time Bank](http://www.timebanking.org/location/rushey-green-time-bank/). As well as giving something back, because we select who gets to make the donation each month at random, it gives us a chance to share some personal stories with each other.

Have a great weekend!

==================

### [Extreme Programming, a Reflection](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/12/10/Thankyou-Kent.html)

I'm not a big fan of Bob Martin and his folksy sobriquet, but I _do_ agree with the majority of this article. Reading the [little white book](http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Extreme_Programming_Explained.html?id=7qJQAAAAMAAJ) back in 2000 profoundly changed the way I thought about software development and the ideas within it remain at the core of my approach.

### [Compilers for Free](http://codon.com/compilers-for-free)

[Tom Stuart](https://twitter.com/tomstuart), our author-in-residence has written up his Ruby Conf talk which is well worth a read - if only for the beautiful animated GIF diagrams! {by james-mead}


### [Building on SOLID foundations](https://vimeo.com/user22258446/review/79095045/9590c62ac2)

I've only watched the first half of this (quite long) video, but [Nat](https://twitter.com/natpryce) & [Steve](https://twitter.com/sf105)'s thesis is that there are lots of well-known principles and rules of thumb for what makes a good class, and there are a bunch of high-level ideas of how to architect a system, but there is little guidance as to how to best compose an object-oriented system so that it's easy to understand and reason about. I think there are some interesting ideas in here. {by james-mead}


### [Jauntful](https://jauntful.com/)

"Create shareable, printable guides to the cities you love". These look really nice. Via [Tom Taylor](https://twitter.com/tomtaylor) & [Jase](https://twitter.com/jasoncale). {by james-mead}


### [Quick Look Plugins](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-look-plugins)

It's really useful to be able to preview files containing Markdown, Git diffs, CSV, etc on Mac OSX. Also [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask) seems really handy. {by james-mead}

### [Indieweb Homebrew website club meeting in London](http://indiewebcamp.com/events/2014-03-19-homebrew-website-club)

Taken from the event page itself:

> Are you building your own website? Indie reader? Personal publishing web app? Or some other digital magic-cloud proxy? If so, come on by and join a gathering of people with likeminded interests. Bring your friends that want to start a personal web site. Exchange information, swap ideas, talk shop, help work on a project, whatever...

We're hosting this at our office next Wednesday (19th March) so please do come along if the paragraph above sounds interesting. {by chris-roos}


### [QuickCast. Make. Publish. Share. 3 Minute Screencasts](http://quickcast.io/)

I had a quick play with this when I was recording the screencast to demonstrate the [FreeAgent transaction helper][]. While it certainly does what it says, I couldn't see any real benefit over recording the screencast with QuickTime Player and hosting that on a service of my choosing (Google Drive in my case). I can see that the automatic creation of gifs could be useful, but they weren't generated for my screencast as it was over the maximum size. {by chris-roos}


### [A Walk Through Time With C A Mathew | Spitalfields Life](http://spitalfieldslife.com/2014/03/07/a-walk-through-time-with-c-a-mathew/)

Great photos taken nearly 100 years apart and merged together. I love those where the people appear to see each other over the gap of time.

I don't know if it's the same artist but these are similar to the ["London now and then" photos on the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-26339275). {by chris-roos}

Week 533
========

Howdy! We're still "between clients" right now so we spent the week on business development (talking to people and applying for things), work on Mission Patch and our other side projects, and a little scheduled (and unscheduled) downtime.

On Monday and Tuesday Ben was struck down with a lurgy while James had a more pleasant time walking on the South Downs.

Chris and I spent the first part of the week emailing and meeting with potential clients. Towards the end of the week our good friends and [CoTech](https://www.coops.tech/) comrades [Outlandish](https://outlandish.com/) got in touch to see if we'd like to work together on one of their projects for a couple of weeks. We've been looking for a way of working together for a long time, so we were delighted to say yes! We're hoping to kick off the work next week.

In general though, it's felt quite tough to find work recently. I think that's due to a number of factors - we have a preference for working as a complete team, but taking on 4 people is quite a big commitment for a lot of the smaller companies we speak to.

Within the public sector, a 4-person development team means a reasonable sized project, and therefore usually one that has to go through public procurement (for example under the [Digital Outcomes framework](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/buyers/frameworks/digital-outcomes-and-specialists-3/requirements/digital-outcomes)). The number of GFR-sized outcomes that are listed under the framework seems to have reduced in the last year or so, and applying for the larger projects requires more time and usually a consortium of partners. We're currently working on a bid. It's taking quite a lot of time and has an uncertain chance of success, but the potential for a considerably sized project makes the effort worthwhile.

It's possible that economic uncertainty and/or financial year-end are playing a part. We're also well-known for being experienced Ruby developers, and although we have a lot of experience with front-end technologies such as Elm and React, back-end frameworks in other languages, devops, data science and other things we've probably not done a great job of marketing ourselves as experts in those areas. We still passionately believe that technology choices come a distant second to getting shit done (or pragmatic, delivery-focussed and agile ways of working if you prefer) and I think we probably need to do a better job of marketing ourselves more widely.

Anyhoo, that's a somewhat long-winded way of saying [get in touch if you'd like to work with us](mailto:lets@gofreerange.com). We're nice and we like helping great teams make cool things.

In other news, we continued work on marketing and feature development for [Mission Patch](https://mission-patch.com). We added back the "classic" [rocket icon](https://mission-patch.com/design) that we'd temporarily lost while working out how to add a large set of Emoji icons. To help support customers we added an [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) widget which integrates with our Slack channel. We also [created some discount codes and offered them to the attendees at a couple of conferences](https://twitter.com/mission_patches/status/1113829762458431488). We're still looking at other ways of sponsoring events, ideally by including some examples of our patches in the conference swag.

Some lovely people at ITV made a cake:

And Ben launched a live-coding YouTube channel with a 4-part series implementing a classic 80s computer game in Elm:

### [Transistor Fabrication: So simple a child can do it](http://hackaday.com/2010/05/13/transistor-fabrication-so-simple-a-child-can-do-it/)

Having had a go at building a NAND gate out of a couple of transistors at the [first NAND2Tetris meeting of the LCC](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/london-computation-club/oiTVvGynzYs/sHX7SRVXy3IJ), I was interested in this demo of someone making a transistor. Someone also asked about vacuum tubes at the meeting - it turns out you can [make those too](http://hackaday.com/2014/11/21/artisanal-vacuum-tubes-hackaday-shows-you-how/)! {by james-mead}


### [Cache is the new RAM](http://blog.memsql.com/cache-is-the-new-ram/)

This is a nice recap of how web application architecture has evolved to work around various bottlenecks and a look forward at where the next ones are likely to be. {by james-mead}


### [OpenWorm](http://www.openworm.org/)

An open-source project to build the first "digital life form", a virtual _C. elegans nematode_ in a computer. {by james-mead}


### [Array#to_proc for Hash access](http://thepugautomatic.com/2014/11/array-to-proc-for-hash-access/)

A simple "hack" which allows you to do things like:

    [ { x: 1 }, { x: 2 } ].map(&[:x]) # => [ 1, 2 ]

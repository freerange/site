### [storytlr open source | your life online](http://storytlr.org/)

I've just had a quick play with this [indieweb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) life streaming application. The app itself is OK although I did have problems trying to import data from flickr and github.

The most interesting aspect was the "Direct Install" option that uses [ComodIT](http://www.comodit.com/) to provision a new AWS instance and install the app for you. I wonder if I could use the recently announced [Heroku Platform API](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2013/5/30/heroku-platform-api-beta) to do something similar for [Roosmarks](https://github.com/chrisroos/roosmarks) or [Money Tracker](https://github.com/chrisroos/money-tracker)? {by chris-roos}


### [Run a blog? Better fix your bounce rate](http://drawingablank.me/blog/fix-your-bounce-rate.html)

> It turns out that Google Analytics will wait for a visitor to trigger a second event, such as visiting another page on the same site. If that second event is never triggered, the visit is counted as a bounce (regardless of the duration of the visit).

I found this really interesting as I suspect it's a problem lots of people run into with a standard "install" of Google Analytics.

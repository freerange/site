### [storytlr open source | your life online](http://storytlr.org/)

I've just had a quick play with this [indieweb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) life streaming application. The app itself is OK although I did have problems trying to import data from flickr and github.

The most interesting aspect was the "Direct Install" option that uses [ComodIT](http://www.comodit.com/) to provision a new AWS instance and install the app for you. I wonder if I could use the recently announced [Heroku Platform API](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2013/5/30/heroku-platform-api-beta) to do something similar for [Roosmarks](https://github.com/chrisroos/roosmarks) or [Money Tracker](https://github.com/chrisroos/money-tracker)? {by chris-roos}


### [Run a blog? Better fix your bounce rate](http://drawingablank.me/blog/fix-your-bounce-rate.html)

> It turns out that Google Analytics will wait for a visitor to trigger a second event, such as visiting another page on the same site. If that second event is never triggered, the visit is counted as a bounce (regardless of the duration of the visit).

I found this really interesting as I suspect it's a problem lots of people run into with a standard "install" of Google Analytics.


### [Understanding Computation Book Club - Chapter 2](http://lanyrd.com/2013/compbookclub/)

A few folk are gathering to read and discuss [Tom's book](http://codon.com/computation-book) at GFRHQ. We're going to be discussing Chapter Two, which is all about _semantics_: determining what a program actually means. You can [read it for free here](http://computationbook.com/sample). You're more than welcome to join us, although I'm starting to get worried that we'll have enough chairs... {by james-adam}


### [Epic Rap Battles of History](http://www.youtube.com/user/ERB)

Off the back of Youtube's recent "Comedy Week", I've been spending a lot of my non-work vegetative time gawping at videos on the internet. This is one series that I've really enjoyed; particular favourites include [Mozart vs. Skrillex](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6Au0xCg3PI), [Tesla vs. Edison](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ1Mz7kGVf0) and [Einstein vs Hawking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn7-fVtT16k), but really, they're all good. {by james-adam}

### [Flight, an event-driven framework from Twitter](http://twitter.github.io/flight/)

> While some web frameworks encourage developers to arrange their code around a prescribed model layer, Flight is organized around the existing DOM model with functionality mapped directly to DOM nodes.

I haven't quite got my head round the pros and cons of this approach, but given that [Dan Webb](https://twitter.com/danwrong) was involved in writing it, I'm sure it's worth some serious attention. {by james-mead}


### [Ruby Object Mapper](https://github.com/rom-rb/rom)

There seems to be a surge in interest in Ruby object-relational mapping libraries. This one uses [axiom](https://github.com/dkubb/axiom) a relational algebra library which I'd not come across before. I've also recently read a bit about [datamappify](https://github.com/fredwu/datamappify) which is built on top of existing ORMs like [ActiveRecord](http://rubydoc.info/gems/activerecord) and is based on the [Repository Pattern](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html) and [Entity Aggregation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/library/ff649505.aspx). {by james-mead}


### [Raildar](http://raildar.co.uk/)

It's great to see another website making use of [Network Rail](http://www.networkrail.co.uk/)'s operational data feeds which were opened up last year. {by james-mead}

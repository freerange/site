Week 881
========

Week beginning Monday, 1st December 2025. I can't quite believe it's already December! 🤯

We've continued to focus on working on [Jam], our open-source online music store, while keeping some business development irons in the fire. We've also all been making a conscious effort to do more exercise - it's often something that slips for me when working on a client project for a sustained period, especially when there are various "fixed" launch dates - so it feels good to get back into better habits. 💪

## Jam 🍓

We've done a lot of talking and thinking about Jam this week. For example, [Chris R] & [Chris L] dug into the details of the pricing model and how to make sure it's sustainable - spreadsheets were involved!

Chris L has been working on adding functionality to support record labels with the involvement of someone who runs a label. We're thinking that this might be one way to attract more artists and music to the platform.

Chris R has been putting together an Investment Readiness Assessment and supporting documents for Polly at [Newable] so we can unlock a few more hours of free business advice.

I've been working on some different ways we could use [Stripe Connect] to make it simpler for artists to receive payments for sales of their music and ideally reduce the administrative burden of operating the site. This has meant digging into a bunch of tax and compliance legislation which reminds me a lot of the time we decided to try [building our own online banking site]!

## Space 4 🪐

On Thursday we met up at [Space 4] and had some useful discussions. Chris R had spent some time digging into the calculations for our [individual pots] and how they relate to our financial forecast. He's come up with some extra calculations which give us some better visibility of the months ahead. We also continued discussions about Jam throughout the day.

We then met up with [Seb] for lunch. It was great to catch up and exchange a bunch of ideas abotu Jam and separately some possible ways to earn money that aren't so inextricably linked to the number of hours we work on a project.

## Miscellaneous 🧩

Earlier in the week, [I added this site] to [We Use Rails] which aims to provide a curated list of [Ruby on Rails] web apps in order to help people curious about Rails discover real-world applications and businesses built with Rails. I noticed that there aren't many other [open-source entries] which is a shame.

I was intrigued to read about [Telebugs], a product by the author of We Use Rails, which describes itself as a self-hosted alternative to Sentry, the exception reporting app. It uses the [ONCE] business model, i.e. a single one-off payment allowing you to self-host the app and get email support. This was particularly interesting given 37Signals' recent decision to move away from ONCE back to a SaaS model.

A while back I read how we [should all be using dependency cooldowns] to mitigate open-source supply chain attacks and mentioned it in Slack. Not long afterwards, Chris R followed this advice and added [the `cooldown` option] to some of our [Dependabot] configurations. 


## Business Development 👔

We're still on the look out for interesting projects, so do [drop us an email] if you'd like a free, no-obligation chat about how we might be able to help. No project too small!

That's all for now!

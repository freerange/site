Week 837
========

Week beginning Monday, 27th January 2025.

We spent the week working on our current project with the [Raspberry Pi Foundation][rpf]. We've been working with the team to determine what to build. We only have a limited time available and so are doing our best to distill exactly what's required to deliver the most value. I think we now have a pretty good idea of where to focus our efforts.

[Chris][chris-lowis], [James][james-mead] and I have continued to spend the majority of our time [mobbing][mobbing]. I'm enjoying this process and am fairly convinced it's the most useful thing to do while we're all getting up to speed on the project. I particularly enjoyed working together in person in our [Space4][space4] office on Thursday. Remote pairing/mobbing goes some way toward capturing the social aspect of work but being in person is even better. We finished the day in the local pub to join our Space4 colleagues in saying goodbye to Polly who leaves [Outlandish][outlandish] and Space4 after 7.5 rewarding years.

I did some more writing on Friday. I created a super simple Rails 8 app for consuming [Fastly][fastly] logs as part of the rubyforge redirects work and have been writing about using [Kamal][kamal] to deploy such an app to a [Digital Ocean][digital-ocean] Droplet, and about the Rails app itself.

I've been encouraging my daughter to get involved in some block based programming at home. We've played with [Scratch][scratch] and this week I bought a [micro:bit][microbit] v2 so that we can experiment with controlling some hardware. We really enjoyed playing with [the program that's pre-installed on the micro:bit out of the box][hello-microbit].

Until next time.

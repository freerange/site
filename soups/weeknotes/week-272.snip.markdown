Week 272
========

G'day, folks. I trust you're all well.

James and I spent most of week 272 continuing to work with [FutureLearn][]. Having spent most of week 271 in more of an investigative mode, it was good to work with FutureLearn to come up with some concrete stories and to then make a start on some of them.

Although we're _only_ working the equivalent of 4 full days each on FutureLearn, we've already slipped behind on some of our other [GFR][] duties. The equivalent of two days a week to deal with our regular [Harmonia][] duties, answer emails, meet people and handle other things that pop up feels like it should be plenty, but that doesn't seem to be the case at the moment. I'm not really sure what the answer apart from to keep an eye on it over the next couple of weeks and try to find bits of our process that we can improve.

Despite suffering from a horrible sounding bug over the weekend, [James][] stuck around for the 5th installment of the [Little Schemer book club] on Monday evening. You can catch up with the [meeting notes on the mailing list][].

As well as having [Chris L][] in the office for his fortnightly day of web audio work, we also had the pleasure of welcoming [Jase][] while he's back in London for a bit. Both of which just about made up for the lack of [Tom S][] who was away visiting [James A][] in Austin.

Until next time, my friends.

Week 309
========

Inevitably this was a relatively quiet week in the lead up to the Christmas break. [Chris][] did his last day at [FutureLearn][] on Monday and then spent much of Tuesday and Wednesday planning the logistics of moving out of our office next year.

The plan is that the [British Heart Foundation][] are going to take away our two smaller sofas, [Hackney Council][] are going to deal with the older chairs & desks we inherited, and [Rocket Van][] are going to move the rest into our self-storage unit.

Chris also did a bit of digging into the history of GFR shares which turns out not to be completely straightforward. It's made me think again about building a simple Share Registrar service for small companies.

On Thursday morning Chris jetted off to the sunshine [Down Under][]. I can't pretend I'm not jealous, but I hope he and Amy have a great holiday!

On Tuesday we hosted another [London Computation Club][] meeting at which chapter four of the [NAND2TETRIS book][] was discussed. [Working through the exercises together][] on the projector was again very rewarding, although this time I was in the driving seat!

For the rest of the week I was holding the metaphorical GFR fort at FutureLearn and doing a lot more [pair programming][]. A few things that have come up in these sessions: outside-in/top-down [test-driven development][] and how it complements [YAGNI][]; writing a failing test *before* fixing a bug; and curating your commits.

For more on the latter, I'm looking forward to [Joel Chippindale]'s [Telling Stories Through Commits][] talk at January's LRUG meeting.

Anyway, I hope everyone has a good break over the festive season.

Best wishes.

-- James.

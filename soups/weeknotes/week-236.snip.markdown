Week 236
========

OK, genuinely short weeknotes this week. Strap in.

{l james-adam,I}'ve had a sandwich week -- two slices of [Harmonia](https://harmonia.io) with a thick layer of client work in the middle of it. It's good to be able to come back to Harmonia more than once in a week though, as it lends a sense of momentum that's otherwise hard to establish.

{l james-mead,James M} and I got our [looking glasses](http://scraplab.net/project-looking-glass/) working, and I'm looking forward to using them in anger. At the moment we use [Sqwiggle](https://www.sqwiggle.com/) to give a sense of connection despite our geographic spread, but it suffers from high CPU usage, which isn't great.

James M also visited [OxRUG]() this week, and got to know some of the local community better, including learning about a co-working space hosted by [White October](http://www.whiteoctober.co.uk/) which he might make some use of. I'm also considering spending a bit of my working day somewhere a bit social; with just me and the cat here in the afternoon, it can make a person go a bit stir-crazy.

On the [Harmonia](https://harmonia.io) front, I did a bit of sketching to figure out some more effective ways of communicating the problem Harmonia solves *and* making it easier to sign up.

{l tom-ward,Tom} has also been doing some work on a new dashboard layout, and on adding the ability to try out new features using [feature flags](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html), which should allow us to more easily experiment and roll out new functionality to subsets of our users.

Naturally, {l chris-roos, Chris} has been on holiday, the lucky blighter. He's back next week though.

So that's that. See you next time,

-- James

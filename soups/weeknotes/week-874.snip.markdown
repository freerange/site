Weeks 872 to 874
================

Weeks beginning 29 Sep, 6 Oct and 13 Oct.

We welcomed [James](/james-mead) back from his epic hiking adventure in the Picos de Europa. Relive James's experience through [this detailed account from his hiking partner](https://cajunlimeys.com/2025/10/02/trekking-spains-picos-de-europa/). Look at that scenery! If you're considering a similar adventure then [this follow-up lesson learned post](https://cajunlimeys.com/2025/10/14/lessons-learned-from-attempting-a-ring-anillo-of-the-picos-de-europa/) might come in handy.

## CoTech Gathering

[Chris](/chris-lowis) and I were among twenty or so like-minded co-operators that attended the [CoTech gathering in Oxford](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/agile-collective_thanks-to-all-those-who-participated-in-the-activity-7381623709901570048-whPY). We spent the day breaking into small groups to discuss how we could get more work into the CoTech network. I came away feeling tired but inspired and energised by all the friendly collaboration.

## Experience CS

We're now in the final weeks of our contract working on [Experience CS](https://experience-cs.org/) with the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). As well as tidying up and handing over to their in house developers, our main focus has been on continuing to extract the Scratch Editor so that it can be used outside of Experience CS. To that end I was really pleased to see it switch to its own domain during the week: a _lot_ of work went on in the background to make this happen seamlessly and with no interruption to existing users. I was also happy to see [the language selector go live in production](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/whats-next-for-experience-cs/): it's been hiding behind a feature flag until the translation team were happy that the content was ready in all supported languages. Chris also made a small change that allowed the curriculum team to introduce [Unit 0](https://experience-cs.org/units/getting-started) which is aimed at getting students used to using the Scratch Editor before moving on to the main curriculum content.

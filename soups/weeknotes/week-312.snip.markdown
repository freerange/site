Week 312
========

HAPPY NEW YEAR!

It was another quiet week with [Chris][] away on his [Antipodean adventure][]. I was back at [FutureLearn][] on Monday, but then immediately struck down by the lurgi for a couple of days.

So other than doing more [pair programming][] at FutureLearn, the usual company admin and preparing to move out of our office, there's not much to report.

Anyway, until next time.

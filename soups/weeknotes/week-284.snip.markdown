Week 284
========

We had an enjoyable, but somewhat low-energy, meeting of the [Little Schemer Book Club][] on Monday at GFRHQ. We staggered as far as the end of chapter 6 aided by a stash of [hipster][] beer and birthday [^1] cake generously supplied by [Tom Stuart][]. The bit I found most interesting was implementing infix arithmetic evaluation in Scheme.

[Chris][] has valiantly continued to migrate our Linode VPS to a new instance. I hesitate to say it, but I really think this is _very nearly_ done!

## Credit Union

Other than that we've spent most of the week beavering away figuring out how to setup a credit union. Amazingly we've been writing up notes every day to try to keep ourselves on track:

* [Day 1][] 
* [Day 2][] 
* [Day 3][] 
* [Day 4][] 

Given the opaqueness of the process and the apparent time & cash involved, I'm increasingly amazed that _anyone_ has ever successfully setup a credit union.

My sense it that much of the documentation is written for the benefit of the regulators and not the credit unions themselves. Let's hope that the [Treasury's Credit Union Consultation][] instigates some improvements in this area.

It also feels as if the whole process is aimed at a credit union that conforms to very old-school ideas of a "business" i.e. up-front investment against a 3-5 year business plan, rather than a lean start-up type approach. Right now I think we're most interested in _questioning_ the appropriateness of some of the hoops that stand in our way.

Anyway, onwards and upwards.

============================

### [Taking the Raspberry Pi 2 for a Test Drive with GNU Radio](http://www.rs-online.com/designspark/electronics/eng/blog/taking-the-raspberry-pi-2-for-a-test-drive-with-gnu-radio-2)

I've been playing around with [GNU Radio](http://gnuradio.org/) applications on the Raspberry Pi recently and I found this tutorial really helpful. {by james-mead}


### [Rails on Docker](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/rails-on-docker)

This is a nice simple walkthrough of how to use Docker to setup a Rails development environment. Also I hadn't come across [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/), the lightweight Linux distribution, or the [headless gem](https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/headless), a Ruby wrapper around Xvfb, before. {by james-mead}


### [JRuby+Truffle - a High-Performance Truffle Backend for JRuby](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki/Truffle)

My involvement in the [London Computation Club](http://london.computation.club/) has made me more interested in the design trade-offs in compilers, interpreters, etc. This experimental implementation of an interpreter for JRuby based on the work of [an Oracle Labs intern](https://github.com/chrisseaton) sounds fascinating.

### [React.js Conf 2015 - Hype!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5e7kWSHWTg)

In this conference talk, Ryan Florence demonstrates some of the power of [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/). I found it all pretty impressive. {by james-mead}


### [Mirage 2014 review: IPv6, TLS, Irmin, Jitsu and community growth](http://openmirage.org/blog/2014-in-review)

A conversation with [Tom S](http://codon.com/) prompted me to read some more about Mirage OS and building Unikernels. There certainly seems to be a lot of work going on in this space. {by james-mead}

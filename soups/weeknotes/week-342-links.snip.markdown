============================

###[Government Service Design Manual - Design Patterns](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/index.html)

This section of the manual and its associated [Hackpad wiki][] looks as if it contains a wealth of useful material about user interface design, much of which is probably relevant to our work on [Smart Answers][]. {by james-mead}

### [Spreadsheets are code: EuSpRIG conference](https://blog.scraperwiki.com/2015/07/eusprig/)

I found David McKee's write-up of a spreadsheet conference (!) really interesting:

> The conference reminded me particularly of one simple fact about spreadsheets that often gets ignored: [Spreadsheets are code](http://www.slideshare.net/Felienne/spreadsheets-are-code-online)

I was particularly interested to learn about [Array Formulae](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093275?hl=en) which was a new one on me. {by james-mead}


###[Copy-Paste Tracking: Fixing Spreadsheets Without Breaking Them](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/publications/iclc2015.pdf)

On a related note, this paper suggests that if you track the copying & pasting of formulae in a spreadsheet and then propogate edits to any of the copies to all the other copies, you can introduce better abstraction into a spreadsheet without complicating the user experience. {by james-mead}


### [The Next Big Thing?](http://www.davefarley.net/?p=254)

Apparently fast, non-volatile memory is likely to be available in the not too distant future. This article talks about what implications that might have on how we design software applications. {by james-mead}


### [Circuit Simulator](http://lushprojects.com/circuitjs/)

Having worked through the early chapters of the [NAND to Tretris][] book with the London Computation Club, I was interested to see this open-source HTML5/JS electronic circuit simulator. {by james-mead}

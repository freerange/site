### [Ruby Rogues Book Club: Understanding Computation with Tom Stuart ](http://rubyrogues.com/120-rr-book-club-understanding-computation-with-tom-stuart/)

I haven't had a chance to listen to this yet, but it's sure to be excellent. Also if you're near London, why not attend the [next meeting of the Understanding Computation Book Club](http://lanyrd.com/2013/understanding-computation-book-club-2-september/) hosted at GFRHQ. {by james-mead}

### [Ruby Rogues Book Club: Understanding Computation with Tom Stuart ](http://rubyrogues.com/120-rr-book-club-understanding-computation-with-tom-stuart/)

I haven't had a chance to listen to this yet, but it's sure to be excellent. Also if you're near London, why not attend the [next meeting of the Understanding Computation Book Club](http://lanyrd.com/2013/understanding-computation-book-club-2-september/) hosted at GFRHQ. {by james-mead}

### [The Neglected Practice of Iteration](http://www.stickyminds.com/sitewide.asp?Function=edetail&ObjectId=13178)

This is an old article, but it's my favourite explanation of the important difference between "iteratively" and "incrementally". Even if you haven't got time to read the whole article, please look at the two figures -- they're worth more than a thousand words. {by james-mead}

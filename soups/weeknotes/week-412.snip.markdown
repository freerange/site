    Took ages because it made me realise that we don't have this listed as a separate project anywhere - I wanted to get the order of it correct.

  Add Hookline music project.
  Improve navigation on individual Show and Tell pages.
  Updated info about me.

Double checked DOS2 submission - agreed that we're happy to go with the answers we gave last time.

James spent some time going through an informational email from our accountant.
  It looks like the only thing that might affect us in future is the changes coming in for public sector contracts.

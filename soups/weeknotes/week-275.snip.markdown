Week 275
========

So last week was another short working week, but despite that I've somehow managed to be a week late in writing up our notes. Sorry. Anyway, I'll keep this brief...

[Chris][] was still on holiday in Portugal for the first half of the week. While he was away, [Tom S][] persuaded me to watch the DHH Rails Conf keynote[^1] on our projector. So that's an hour of my life I'm not going to get back. However, I did enjoy the ensuing discussions with Tom in the office over the next couple of days.

In the spirit of trying to automate some of our admin tasks, I knocked up a quick [script to backup our Trello data to Dropbox][trello-backup]. I haven't used the APIs for either [Trello][] nor [Dropbox][] before, so that was of some vague interest. As usual the main hurdle with both of them was authentication, but I got there in the end.

When Chris was back I introduced him to the new company song, [We are the Battery Human][] by Stornoway, which was suggested by [Chris L][]'s brother. We plan to sing along to it every morning when we arrive in the office:

> Cause we're the new generation, generation! We are the battery human! But we were born to be free range. Free range. Whoa.

Work-wise, we continued on the [FutureLearn][] video project. Progress was slower than we'd have liked, but we definitely made progress.

[Paul][] very kindly brought his old coffee maker into the office, so now we can brew vast quantities of [Pact Coffee][] with very little effort. Thanks, Paul.

I finished off the week with a quick lunchtime trip to the [Matisse: The Cut-Outs][the-cut-outs] exhibition with [Tom W][]. The exhibition was great, if a bit busy, and it was good to catch up with Tom too.

Anyway, that's all folks. Hopefully the notes for this week won't be quite as tardy.

-- James.

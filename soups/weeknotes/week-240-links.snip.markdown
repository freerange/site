### [Android and some time lapse(ish) magic](http://chrisroos.co.uk/blog/2013-08-14-android-and-some-time-lapse-ish-magic)

This is nothing but some shameless self promotion. I'm experimenting with using [LapseIt Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ui.LapseItPro&hl=en) and [Folder Sync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.full&hl=en) to upload images every 5 minutes or so to Amazon S3 from my old Android phone. At the moment I have a [simple website](http://thames-time-lapse.herokuapp.com/images) to display the most recent image but I have lots of ideas as to how I might extend it in future. {by chris-roos}

### [The next second](http://prospects.mhurrell.co.uk/post/the-next-second)

Our old GDS colleague [Mark Hurrell](http://prospects.mhurrell.co.uk/) has some interesting thoughts about [this sponsored documentary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BqFkRwdFZ0) about the dangers of texting and driving.  Read Mark's thoughts then watch the documentary. After all, it is Werner-fucking-Herzog. {by tom-ward}

### [Do things, write about it](http://mdswanson.com/blog/2013/08/11/write-things-tell-people.html)

> ... you need to do only two things to put yourself in a position to encounter interesting work: make something cool and then tell people about it.

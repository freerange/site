Week 405
========

## Monday

* Both
  * Spent about 30 minutes going through Trello
  * Spent about 60 minutes going through Trello Later list
  * Good chat over lunch about prioritising work.
  * Want to look back on this time and think that we've achieved something.
  * Lots of little actionable tasks are added to Trello. Does this prevent us from working on some larger, more ambiguous, more fun things?
  * Could we schedule blocks of time for working on non-admin things? Not everything in Trello is an admin task, though.
  * Maybe there's a way to reframe the tasks so that they're more enjoyable - give more sense of progress?
* James
  * Write notes for 403
* Started using randomness in ruby for card assignment. Maybe started this last week.

## Tues

* James
  * personal admin
* Chris
  * working on website and mocha.
    * What did i do on the website?
    * Mocha - try to reduce number of pull requests.

## Weds

* Chris
  * at the boat all day.
* James
  * mostly working on hookline. Solved problem with id3 tags and large artwork causing mp3 not to play in chrome.

## Thurs

* Both
  * worked together at BFI
  * Spent nearly an hour going through harmonia tasks to understand whether they could be outsourced. This was useful exercise. Made me realise that there were good candidates. Although, it also made me think that we could potentially automate some of the things we do. This became more obvious when trying to think about how someone else might complete the tasks. The problem with automating trivial tasks is that we run the risk of ultimately making things more complicated.
  * Wrote 2 old week note blog posts. This was much easier having done it together. And more enjoyable.
  * Lunch at pieminster. Chat about higher level aims and goals. Agreed to a weekly planning meeting to agree what we're going to work on. Otherwise we can end up working on things that we think are useful. That work might come from a good place but might not fit with higher level goals. Reminded us that we've tried to come up with higher level company goals in the past. Is it really useful? I don't know.
  * Went through some of our project ideas this afternoon. Hopefully we'll make this a more regular task.

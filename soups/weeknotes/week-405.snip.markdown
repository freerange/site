Week 405
========

* Monday
  * Both
    * Spent about 30 minutes going through Trello
    * Spent about 60 minutes going through Trello Later list
    * Good chat over lunch about prioritising work.
    * Want to look back on this time and think that we've achieved something.
    * Lots of little actionable tasks are added to Trello. Does this prevent us from working on some larger, more ambiguous, more fun things?
    * Could we schedule blocks of time for working on non-admin things? Not everything in Trello is an admin task, though.
    * Maybe there's a way to reframe the tasks so that they're more enjoyable - give more sense of progress?
  * James
    * Write notes for 403

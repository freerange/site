### [Official Google Blog: Google+ Stories and Movies: memories made easier](http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/google-stories-and-movies-memories-made.html)

### [Optimise for the common case. - Habitat - a programmable personal datastore (early progress)](http://blog.oftcc.net/post/86240985111/habitat-a-programmable-personal-datastore-early)

Week 160
========

Despite having [tended][Harmonia Issue 10] [Harmonia's][Harmonia Issue 4] [wounds][Harmonia Issue 6], having jinxed it with [last week's][Week 159] opening paragraph, she's pointed her fickle finger at me again.

### Whitehall

This week we've started to handover the GovUK [Whitehall app][] to our colleagues ([Paul][Paul Battley], [James][James Stewart], [James][James Weiner] and [Ben][Ben Terrett]), who until recently have been working on the [citizen-facing apps](http://gov.uk). A typical IT project handover has the project grind to a halt while the outgoing team write wads of documentation before departing abruptly, leaving the incoming team to pick up the pieces. We're really encouraged that [Pete][Pete Herlihy] and the rest of the [GDS][] team shares our view that it's much better tackle the handover in a more [collaborative and iterative manner][Agile Handover], [valuing people over process and working software over documentation][Agile Manifesto].

To this end our aim is to help our new team-mates get up to speed as quickly as possible as we gradually reduce our involvement in the project. This is always going to be a bit of a tricky balancing act, but hopefully we're off to a good start. It certainly helps that the Whitehall app is already integrated into the [GovUK ecosystem][] and that we have comprehensive suites of [automated][Whitehall tests] [tests][Whitehall features] which can act as living documentation.

This week has also seen a welcome influx of writers and editors from across government, such that the Whitehall team now form _two_ serried ranks amidst the hot-desking mêlée at [Aviation House][]. It's really good to have these folk on-site and able to give us direct feedback on what we've built and great to see more and more content appearing on the site. Although internally we're [always releasing][Continuous Deployment], the imminent _public_ release of the Whitehall app has been [focussing][Pete Herlihy] [minds][Neil Williams] on [story prioritisation][Whitehall Pivotal].

Hasta la vista.

&mdash; James.

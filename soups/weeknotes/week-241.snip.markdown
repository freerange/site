Week 241
========

Good afternoon, folks.

It's been a short and light week in GFR, what with the splendid bank holiday weekend and both [James A](/james-adam) and [Tom](/tom-ward) being away.

[James M](/james-mead) and [I](/chris-roos) have managed to keep ourselves occupied though: spending half our time on [FutureLearn](http://futurelearn.com/), and half on [GFR](/).

On the FutureLearn front, we had a great response to a recent batch of invites that were sent out, with over 50% of those invited going on to register for the platform. It'd be great if that turns out to be indicative of the level of interest we'll see once it's opened up to everyone.

And on the GFR front, James M and I have started documenting our GFR development process. I think it's fair to say that the four of us all have a similar approach to developing software, but we've never actually spent the time to define it. It's been really good to revisit some of the reasons *why* we work in the way we do, and hopefully we'll end up with something that we can point to when we talk to people about our approach.

I hope you all have a great weekend.

Monday Links - 254
==================

### [ZenPen](http://www.zenpen.io/)

I really like this minimal browser based text editor. I wonder if something like this could be used to bridge the gap between a plain old textarea and a full on wysiwyg editor. {by chris-roos}


### [GistBox](http://www.gistboxapp.com/)

I've been using this on and off for a couple of weeks now. It's an alternative interface to Github's gists that supports labelling and searching. I've found the labelling particularly useful for grouping gists related to the same project together. {by chris-roos}

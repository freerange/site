Week 177
--------

I'm afraid this is going to be a rather spartan set of notes, because I'm due to head off camping and climbing in the Peak District - vainly hoping that the wind and rain will subside soon.

The working week has been very short, courtesy of her majesty, and a couple of our courageous quartet took the chance to fit in a bit of holiday. [Tom](/tom-ward) has been away in Cornwall and [Chris](/chris-roos) has been at a friend's wedding in Sicily. Meanwhile "team James" has been holding the fort at [GDS][].

[James A](/james-adam) celebrated the Jubilee by persuading the [GFR printer](https://twitter.com/#!/gfrprinter) to churn out [union jack bunting](http://public.lazyatom.com/printer/bunting.html) like there's no tomorrow :-

[James A](/james-adam) also spent a day working with [another James](https://twitter.com/#!/jamesweiner) on a secret [receipt printer](https://github.com/freerange/printer) project. Hopefully all will be revealed at some point.

This week we've also had the pleasure of re-engaging with the Capita procurement system with welcome assistance from our trusty [project manager](https://twitter.com/#!/yahoo_pete). Although we don't have to jump through quite so many hoops as last time, it still seems like an overly complex bit of bureaucracy. We had to [revise our company structure](https://twitter.com/lazyatom/status/210705345503440897) slightly in order to meet one of the requirements. It seems as if the idea of a company where no one person is in charge does not compute.

Meanwhile back at [GDS][], we welcomed [Neil](https://twitter.com/#!/neillyneil) back from his Bognor beach hut and continued work on the next phase of the [Whitehall project](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/367813)...

I'm sure I've missed out something important, but I've gotta go.

Week 296 - Interesting links
============================

### [Sunrise Calendar](https://sunrise.am/)

I read about this calendar in the [Todoist blog post that mentioned Sunrise integration][todoist-sunrise-integration]. I've had a play with it in Chrome and also installed the Android app. I'm really impressed so far. I love the little touches like showing avatars of event invitees and displaying a different icon based on the name of the event. {by chris-roos}


### [Dimensions Browser Extension](http://felixniklas.com/dimensions/)

I find this quite amazing. A Chrome extension that shows the distance between various objects in an html page. It doesn't feel like the sort of extension I'll use everyday, but I've certainly encountered situations in the past where it would've come in handy. There's a demo on the homepage so you can get an idea of how it works without installing the extension. {by chris-roos}


### [New Highrise annoucements](http://blog.highrisehq.com/post/97143153266/highrise-announcements-gmail-forwards-sent-emails)

This appears to be the first update since [Highrise was spun out of Basecamp][basecamp-spin-off-highrise]. The post contains some general information about the future as well as specific information about some feature updates. The feature that caught my eye in particular in described in, ["Previously Sent Email"][highrise-previously-sent-email]: We definitely suffered from the problem of forgetting to BCC emails when using Highrise so it's great to read that they've introduced a workaround to address that specific problem. {by chris-roos}

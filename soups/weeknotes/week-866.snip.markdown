Week 866
========

Week beginning Monday, 18th August 2025.

[Chris][chris-lowis] has been on leave this week, I've had a couple of days off to look after my daughter, [Seb][seb-jacobs] took Thursday off and [James][james-mead] worked slightly reduced hours on the [Experience CS][experience-cs] project.

As things stand we've only got one week left on the project so we've been trying to juggle handing over to Fraser alongside feature development.

James finished off a couple of bits of the translation work which means that the translation team are now able to translate all the curriculum content on the site.

Seb finished the work that allows a project to be associated with multiple lessons in the curriculum. This is part of an ongoing effort to ensure that the modelling of the curriculum in the app matches the curriculum content being created by the learning team.

I made a small change that attempts to better describe in code the split between the Scratch API endpoints and the other Experience CS API endpoints.

We continued to add metrics to a [Looker Studio][looker-studio] dashboard to help the product team measure/understand use of the product, and of the effects of any changes that are made in future.

Until next time.

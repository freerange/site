Week 403
========

* Working together at BFI Benugo on Monday
* Going through Trello regularly
  * Feels as if we've got into a better state with this
  * Although still need to revisit Later & missed week notes
* We tested that our UK Postbox address was working OK and made a start on changing our address with various entities, e.g. HMRC (multiple places), Companies House, bank, etc.
* We both did a bit of work on Mocha to move us closer to a v1.2 release.
* Chris spoke to Paul re annual accounts
  * Unfortunately we haven't been able to get to the bottom of a small discrepancy between our FreeAgent accounts and the annual accounts generated by our accountant.
  * Materiality - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materiality_(auditing)
  * We agreed that our accountant could go ahead and submit our accounts.
* I spent the majority of the week working on our collaboration with Hookline.
* Chris spent the majority of the week trying to get his houseboat ready to re-launch.

  ork for some reason

  services) as early as possible

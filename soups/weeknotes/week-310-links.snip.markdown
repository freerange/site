### [The Case for Slow Programming](http://ventrellathing.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/the-case-for-slow-programming/)

While I have some sympathy with the idea of the [Slow Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_programming) movement, I'm not convinced that slowing down the release cycle is a good tactic. To my mindm, thoughtful, careful design is not incompatible with making small incremental improvements to the code.

I'm also unconvinced of the author's implied rejection of [collective code ownership](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/collective.html). Although admittedly difficult to achieve in practice, it is possible to establish a shared thoughtful, careful design approach *across a team*. Via [Chris Roos](/chris-roos). {by james-mead}


### [RTL-SDR](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/)

This may be old news to people, but I was intrigued to discover this [open-source software-defined radio](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr) which is designed to work with the Realtek RTL2832U chipset found in [low-cost DVB-T TV tuner dongles](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/).

My specific interest is in seeing whether I can build a cheap [AIS receiver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Identification_System). Typically these cost a few hundred pounds, but I'm hoping I can get [something like this](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-tutorial-cheap-ais-ship-tracking/) running on a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) for not too many pennies. {by james-mead}


### [OpenCPN](http://opencpn.org/)

While I was investigating the idea of building an AIS receiver, I came across this impressive-looking open-source chart plotter and navigation software. I'm thinking about trying to get it up and running on a cheap laptop or tablet. {by james-mead}


### [Faster Builds with Container-Based Infrastructure and Docker](http://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-12-17-faster-builds-with-container-based-infrastructure/)

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) for both client & open-source work and we've definitely noticed a significant improvement in performance after these changes. Via [Seb Jacobs](http://sebjacobs.com). {by james-mead}


### [co-op v2?](http://blog.memespring.co.uk/2014/12/01/co-op-v2/)

I'm not entirely sure that I understand what Richard Pope is getting at here, but I think he's right that there is something interesting in the decentralized nature of the [Bitcoin blockchain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#The_block_chain). Via [Chris Roos](/chris-roos). {by james-mead}


### [Map the Banks](http://mapthebanks.com/)

Financial institutions are required by law to produce a mountain of data, but little meaningful analysis has been done on it.

This [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com/) project aims to tackle the problem in order to provide greater transparency into the finance sector and they are looking for developers [to take on missions to build scrapers](https://missions.opencorporates.com/campaigns/8). {by james-mead}


### [credEcardplus](http://www.contisgroup.com/credecardplus)

This e-Money payment card by Contis seems to offer an individual sort-code and account number which was something we struggled to find during our [Credit Union project](/credit-union). What's more it looks as if they are already [partnering with credit unions](http://www.contisgroup.com/sectors/credit-unions).

Week 849
========

Week beginning Monday, 21st April 2025.

It's a short week this week as we all enjoyed a longer weekend due to Easter.

[Chris L][chris-lowis] has taken the week off to move house and we're keeping our fingers crossed for a seamless transition to their new home.

We've had another productive week on [Experience CS][experience-cs]. [James][james-mead] and I have been pairing quite a bit and making progress on saving Scratch projects to [RPF's Editor API][rpf-editor-api] while Seb's been starting to build some basic curriculum CMS functionality using [Administrate][administrate], and digging into a gnarly iOS bug in Scratch.

James dug into a [Mocha][mocha] build failure to discover that it was caused by a [regression bug in JRuby][mocha-754]. He [reported it to JRuby][jruby-8784] and [a fix][jruby-8785] was soon applied. Good work, James!

James also helped me out by [requesting an RSS feed][james-ai-blog-rss] for the [AI.GOV.UK blog][ai-blog] when I moaned that I couldn't subscribe. Thanks, James!

We wish [Seb][seb-jacobs] luck in the London Marathon on Sunday. [He's fundraising for the British Heart Foundation][seb-fundraising] and I'm sure he'd appreciate a donation if you feel so inclined.

Until next time.

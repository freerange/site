### [BERG Cloud DevKit](http://bergcloud.com/devkit/)

BERG are making a 'shield' board for connecting Arduinos, Raspberry Pis and
mbed boards to their 'cloud'. It looks like 'BERG Cloud' performs the same role
as my [Printer](/printer) server (which is: taking the all of the hard but
boring part of turning a web page into a physical thing), but extends it beyond
printing, to any kind of interaction driven by a backend server.

It raises questions for me personally about the future of my Printer project,
since a) part of the motivation for me to release it was because it wasn't clear
to what extent BERG would be opening up access to their service for 'hacking',
and b) the [architectures]() of BERG Cloud and Printer seem very similar. I guess
we'll see.

... and it's gone again.

You can read some discussion on Hacker News [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5015087),
but more significantly you can get a PDF of all of the PCL SPOOL files
in [a collection aptly-titled 'CLOSURE'](https://github.com/steveklabnik/CLOSURE).

when I discovered Ruby, and I suspect I will always be nostaglic for the time
when he was still writing.

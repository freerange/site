### [BERG Cloud DevKit](http://bergcloud.com/devkit/)

BERG are making a 'shield' board for connecting Arduinos, Raspberry Pis and
mbed boards to their 'cloud'. It looks like 'BERG Cloud' performs the same role
as my [Printer](/printer) server (which is: taking the all of the hard but
boring part of turning a web page into a physical thing), but extends it beyond
printing, to any kind of interaction driven by a backend server.

It raises questions for me personally about the future of my Printer project,
since a) part of the motivation for me to release it was because it wasn't clear
to what extent BERG would be opening up access to their service for 'hacking',
and b) the [architectures]() of BERG Cloud and Printer seem very similar. I guess
we'll see. {by james-adam}


### [whytheluckystiff.net is back up...](http://whytheluckystiff.net)

... and it's gone again.

You can read some discussion on Hacker News [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5015087),
but more significantly you can get a PDF of all of the PCL SPOOL files
in [a collection aptly-titled 'CLOSURE'](https://github.com/steveklabnik/CLOSURE).

when he was still writing. {by james-adam}


### [Developing on a Chromebook](http://www.simonmweber.com/2013/04/20/development-on-a-chromebook-an-opinionated-guide.html)

Something for {l chris-roos,Chris} here: one strategy for using a Chromebook to do _real work_ (i.e. software development). {by james-adam}

### [Short's Not Always Sweet: The Case for Long Test Names](https://m.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=564493423583526)

Kent Beck gives some interesting insight into _why_ he uses long names for test methods and shorter ones for other methods. {by james-mead}

### [Working with Ruby Threads](http://www.workingwithrubythreads.com/)

I read [Working with Unix Processes](http://www.workingwithunixprocesses.com/) by Jesse Storimer a while ago and found the explanations very clear. I read _Working with Ruby Threads_ on my train on Friday and had a similar positive experience. {by james-mead}

### [dispatch.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch)

In my continuing quest to perfect my vim development environment, I'm really impressed with Tim Pope's latest offering. I can now run a test and see the full output appear temporarily in a tmux pane, but then have any failures appear in a vim quickfix window which take me to the relevant lines in the file. {by james-mead}

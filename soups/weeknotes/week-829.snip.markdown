Week 829
========

Week beginning Monday, 2nd December 2024.

Chris and I had a busy start to the week. Our project to build a spike/prototype for our client was coming to an end. On a longer project we prefer to hand over by working with an existing team, ideally [pair programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html).

The aim of this project was for us to take an outsider's perspective on a tricky future problem, so we decided to communicate our findings with a demo and a Q&A. We also wrote down our thoughts and technical approach in the repo's README, linking to relevant parts of the code.

We also took the opportunity to style the prototype using [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). When prototyping there's a danger of making it look more finished than it really is. But it can, understandably, be hard for some people to see beyond unstyled HTML! Working with the team's designer I think we found a nice balance.

For the rest of the week we've been tying up loose ends before entering a slightly longer-than-usual winter break. Chris and I are travelling abroad to see family (in Australia and Colombia respectively) and James has a ski trip planned. Fortunately we've had some really positive conversations about a new project to start in Janauary, so we can go into the break feeling a little more relaxed.

This afternoon I'm meeting a few [CoTech](https://www.cotech.uk/) friends to celebrate Siôn Whellens receiving his pension. Siôn is a good friend of GFR and [helped us](/weeks-520-to-524#becoming-a-co-op) when we became a (legal) co-operative. His [impact on the worker co-op movement](https://coopfinance.coop/2023/08/15/fifty-years-of-friendship-and-finance-meet-sion-whellens/) cannot be overstated and we wish him all the best.

Weeknotes may go a little quiet for the next few weeks, but from all of us at GFR, we wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.

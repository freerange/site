Week 868 & 869
==============

Weeks commencing Mon 1 and Mon 8 Sep.

[Chris][chris-lowis] has now returned from his Summer holidays.

I took a few days off to look after my daughter before she returned to school after the school holidays.

[James][james-mead] has gone on leave this week to prepare for an epic sounding two week hiking trip in Spain.

We managed to find a day in between all that leave to meet-up at our office in [Space4][space4]. I always enjoy meeting in person and this time was no exception. We spent the day in the office generally catching up on personal and business life, and we spent the early evening at a local pub where we joined by fellow cooperators and friends, [Polly][polly-robbins] and [Szczepan][szczepan-orlins].

Main topics of discussion were around what we do after the [Raspberry Pi Foundation][rpf] project, how to better communicate what we do (help come up with solutions to solve problems), and how we do it (ideally with a small team that's fully empowered to solve problems), and working on internal projects.

Aside from that we've continued to work on the [Experience CS][experience-cs] project: focussing on improving some of the classroom management functionality in [Code Editor for Education][cefe], and on improving the modelling/administration of the curriculum content in Experience CS. We've recently been extended for another few weeks on the project and one of the things we're keen to do is leave the Scratch Editor in a state that allows it to be used by more than just Experience CS. We've started having conversations about how to approach this and hope to start working on it soon.

Until next time.

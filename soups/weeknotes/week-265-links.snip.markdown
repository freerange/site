Week 265 - Interesting links
============================

### [Every line of code is always documented](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2014/02/hidden-documentation/)

This is roughly inline with the themes discussed at [TICOSA](http://ticosa.org/). The author gives some useful git tips to help with digging into the story of the code, as well some general tips to help you be nice to your future self and colleagues. {by chris-roos}

### [Sublime Text plugin to show the git commit history for one or more lines of code](https://github.com/cbumgard/GitCommitMsg)

I haven't tried this but it looks like it could be useful shortcut for finding the commit history for a specific line of code. The author says they were inspired by the [Every line of code is always documented](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2014/02/hidden-documentation/) post. {by chris-roos}

### [rel="source"](http://adactio.com/journal/6667/)

This reminded me of a thought I'd had about linking web pages (e.g. blog posts or news articles) to their source in version control (assuming that's how they're stored). I can imagine that such a machine readable link would make it possible to add something to the browser to give a nice view of the history of the page over time. {by chris-roos}

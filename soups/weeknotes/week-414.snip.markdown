Week 414
========

We had a fairly easy last week before Christmas.

We both spent quite a while writing and publishing historic weeknotes and managed to clear the backlog that we'd built up during the year. Despite questioning the value in the exercise (and in writing weeknotes in general) we were both very happy to get these all done.

## Google Drive backups

We store quite a lot of data in [Google Drive][google-drive]. Data that we'd miss if it weren't available. We've previously tried using [Google Takeout][google-takeout] to create a backup of the data but that only seemed to include files created by an individual user, rather than all files we have access to.

[James][james-mead] spent some time exploring [rclone][rclone] which looks as though it might do what we want.

## GDS

We continued to make progress in getting signed up with [Digital Gurus][digital-gurus]/[Capita][capita] so that we can do some more work with [GDS][gds].

## Cooperative Technologists

James improved our page on the [CoTech][co-tech] website and tried to help a fellow co-op find someone to help with some web design work.

Until next time.

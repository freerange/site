Week 397
========

_Note that we're writing these notes nearly 6 months late which is why they're in bullet point form._

* We split our time between GFR and Hookline but with a focus on Hookline.

## GFR

* Continued working through the annual accounts.

* Started using Google Calendar events to trigger Harmonia tasks as we get slightly finer grained control over dates, e.g. we can say that Show & Tell starts on the second Wednesday of the month.

## Hookline

* Served the app using a hookline.tv domain.

* Added Rubocop.

* Continued normalising the data in the database and adding sensible constraints and validations.

* Switched to using GUIDs for the S3 objects.

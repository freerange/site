Week 302 - Interesting links
============================

### [Whatfettle ⁓ One CSV, thirty stories](http://blog.whatfettle.com/2014/10/13/one-csv-thirty-stories/)

I've really enjoyed following Paul's posts about digging into some Land Registry data. I particularly like the use of common unix utilities, including sed and awk, to explore the data. {by chris-roos}


### ["Did you mean?" Experience in Ruby](http://www.yukinishijima.net/2014/10/21/did-you-mean-experience-in-ruby.html)

This looks like it could come in useful: Misspell a method name in Ruby and it'll suggest some likely alternatives. I've had a really quick play with it and it seems to work well. {by chris-roos}


### [GitHub Pages For The Rest Of Us](http://blog.jonudell.net/2014/10/21/github-pages-for-the-rest-of-us/)

I've been thinking about using GitHub Pages but editing on GitHub to get a wiki like experience for a while now. It's somewhat reassuring to read about someone else using it in this way. {by chris-roos}


### [Why we retired the feedly URL shortener](http://blog.feedly.com/2014/10/28/feedly-url-shortener-retired/)

> As part of the feedly web and mobile 24 update, we retired the feedly URL shortener. It felt like the right thing to do for users and makes us a better citizen of the Web.

I can't imagine this was an easy decision to make but it certainly feels like the right thing to do. {by chris-roos}


### [New Google+ Share Button](http://googlesystem.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/new-google-share-button.html)

I noticed this new Google Plus share button a couple of days ago and had to do a double take as it looks very similar to a [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com) plus (+) icon. {by chris-roos}

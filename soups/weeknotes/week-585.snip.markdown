Week 585
========

Week beginning Mon 30 March.

- [Chris][chris-lowis] and his partner welcomed their second child into the world. I understand they're all at home and well. Congratulations. This is wonderful news :-)

- [Ben][ben-griffiths] and [James][james-mead] started working with [FutureLearn][futurelearn] after they got in touch to ask whether we could help cover some of their team working reduced hours.

- I worked on a new interface for the Lightbox project that aims to guide researchers through the process of including lighting data in their papers.

- We agreed to exercise the break clause in our office lease only to learn that our landlord was happy for us to move to a rolling monthly contract at a greatly reduced rate to store our equipment. We've taken this option as it avoids us having to collect/store our equipment and gives us some hope we'll be back in there in future.

- We've explored some of the options available to help us through this time. We've furloughed Chris, postponed our next VAT payment, investigated the [Business Interruption Loan Scheme][cbils], learnt that we're hopefully eligible for the [Small Business Grant Scheme][grant] and have started exploring how much we can afford to reduce our salary by.

- We've retired our self-hosted [errbit][errbit] instance in favour of [Rollbar][rollbar]. The cost of maintaining our own instance was outweighing any benefits we might've seen.

- We've configured [freerange.coop][freerange-coop] to redirect to [gofreerange.com][gofreerange-com]. We've had freerange.coop since becoming a member of [Coops UK][coops-uk] and figured we should do _something_ with it even if that's just configuring a redirect. We had a brief conversation about making it our primary domain but it felt like that warranted some more thought/discussion.

- James has written a blog post to describe [how he's using the AWS CDK to automatically backup our company Trello boards to AWS S3][aws-cdk-trello]

- We used [Whereby][whereby] for our monthly drinks on Wednesday. I thought it worked really well and I enjoyed spending an hour or two catching up with folks.

- There's a new Slack channel for the [Catalyst Digital Teams network][catalyst-digital-teams], which alerted me to a [project Outlandish completed for Business in the Community][outlandish-bitc] in just over 24 hours! It's inspiring to see people from various, potentially competing, organisations sharing leads and working out how to work together.

- We used our monthly charitable donation to contribute to the crowdfunder for [Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for NHS Staff][masks4nhs].

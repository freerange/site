Week 326
========

We spent Monday to Thursday working for our new client. Unfortunately for the moment I can't tell you who our client is or what we've been up to! Or at least I could, but then I'd have to kill you, so probably better if I don't.

Anyway we've got some interesting problems to solve and we hope to be able to tell you about them in due course.

Inevitably we spent all of Friday catching up with admin. Chris did a great job of writing up the [most recent Show and Tell event][show-and-tell-11] and I did a less good job of writing up [notes for the week][week-325].

After faffing about with a tape measure and a spirit level, we used some clever 3M sticky velcro things to put our new logo sign up on the wall of the office. We're quite pleased with how it looks and thankfully it does look pretty horizontal!

Anyway, that's all for this week.

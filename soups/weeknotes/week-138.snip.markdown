Week 138
========

It's so easy to get completely caught up in work that you lose sight of *why* you're working.

With that in mind, we've decided to make an effort to take that step back and talk about what's going on inside [Castle GFR](/). We believe in transparency, so it's an obvious way to demonstrate that.

This week it's my turn. I'm already two days late, and we've got a lot to catch up on.

### O2 Labs

After handing [#blue][] to [O2 Labs][] at the start of August, we've done a bit more work for them exploring how they can help developers to engage with other parts of their infrastructure.

I wish we could say more, but sometimes clients are a bit sheepish. Fair enough. Perhaps we'll give the project a codename.

### The Office

For the past few weeks we've taken a break from that work to make progress with our new office.

After walking across most of London - twice - we found a good space just around the corner on [Worship Street][]. Chris and I met with our solicitors to go over the lease and generally learn more about what we're getting ourselves into. We're hoping to move in within the next few weeks.

### Harmonia, the Chaos Administrator

One of the fundamental ideas behind our company is that everyone involved should be a *maker*, but that doesn't mean that administrative chores can be ignored. We've tried a few different approaches for handling this, but have settled on a simple system that adds a sprinkling of entropy into our operation.

It started as a simple script called chaos.rb, but we're pushing more and more into it as we find tasks that fit. For the curious, [it's called harmonia][harmonia].


### Miscellany

[Tom](/tom-ward) has been exploring [a simple set of deployment recipes that leverage git][tomafro-deploy], and we've been trying them out. There are a few rough edges, but it looks very promising so far, and it's *very* fast.

We've been using [Highrise][] to give everyone visibility of what's going on in the company, but when someone forgets to BCC or forward an email, it causes a hiccup. This wastes time, so we've spent a bit of time thinking about other solutions, from a single shared mail account to some custom software. [I](/james-adam) have been spiking some scripts to automatically produce a single, searchable view of every email in and out of Free Range. There's nothing worth looking at yet, and we're still exploring what flow will really work for our company.

Week 364
========

Happy New Year!

Although theoretically this week marked our "return" after the Christmas and New Year break, in practice we were both mostly still busy with non-GFR things.

Chris was in or around Melbourne, Australia, with Amy's family and I was in London preparing for my skiing adventures in Switzerland. I found this period a bit stressful - trying to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything and hoping that everything I wanted to take would fit in my luggage. Hopefully Chris had a more relaxing time!

Other than a bunch of the usual admin, there was a bit extra associated with us vacating our office at Shoreditch Works at the end of last year. Other than that, the only things of note were:

* We decided to put the [Show and Tell event][] on hold until I'm back in the UK more permanently in April.

* I finished sorting out our new [NEST Pension][] which in theory means we are now ready for our [Auto Enrolment staging date][] of 1st April, 2016.

Anyway, writing this up is part of a concerted effort to "catch up" with our week note backlog. So hopefully you can look forward to more thrilling installments in the days ahead!

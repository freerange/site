Monday Links - 251
==================

### [Recent Bookmarks](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recent-bookmarks/olndffocioplakeilhkgenfgdincjlpn)

This is a neat little Chrome extension that groups your recent (up to 25) bookmarks by day, making it much easier to scan back over things that you've bookmarked in order to read later. {by chris-roos}

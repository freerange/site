Week 497
========

Chris L was on holiday on Tuesday and I was still away on my extended break.

Most of the week we continued to be busy working on the Trainline project which we started a couple of weeks ago.

Chris L filled in our application for version 3 of the government's Digital Marketplace Digital Outcomes & Specialists framework.

On Wednesday we held our [Show & Tell event for July][show-and-tell-46].

Not much else to report!

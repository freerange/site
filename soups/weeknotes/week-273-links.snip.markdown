Week 273 - Interesting links
============================

### [Whiteboard picture cleaner](https://gist.github.com/lelandbatey/8677901)

I haven't tried this script but I like the idea of it. Use it tidy up photos of whiteboard scrawls. {by chris-roos}


### [Welcome to Brewhouse](http://brewhouse.io/2014/04/04/welcome-to-brewhouse.html)

We wish Kalv and the team all the best in their new venture, and will be sure to keep an eye on how they're managing the mix of client work and product development. {by chris-roos}


### [My Prop 8 blog post from 2008](http://scripting.com/2014/04/05/myProp8BlogPostFrom2008.html)

It wasn't so much the content of this post that I found interesting, but more the idea that we should be able to record our current line of thinking without feeling as though that would prevent us from changing our mind in future. I think Dave's comment actually sums this up best.  {by chris-roos}

> That's why it's good to write blog posts. I wrote that Apple was doomed after Jobs came back. Believe me, every time I say something about Apple, I hear about that post. It's what I thought at the time. We live and learn, and grow and change our minds all the time. Some people think that's a failing, I think it's our strength.


### [Readmill Epilogue](https://readmill.com/epilogue)

> Readmill’s story ends here. Many challenges in the world of ebooks remain unsolved, and we failed to create a sustainable platform for reading. For this, we’re deeply sorry. We considered every option before making the difficult decision to end the product that brought us together.

I only recently came across Readmill and it looked like a really nice service. It's a real shame they're having to shut down. {by chris-roos}

Week 300 - Interesting links
============================

### [Qaop/JS - ZX Spectrum Emulator](http://torinak.com/qaop/info)

Having cut my software teeth on the Sinclair ZX80, ZX81 and Spectrum, I enjoyed playing some [retro games](http://torinak.com/qaop/games) on the Qaop ZX-Spectrum emulator which has been ported to JavaScript. {by james-mead}


### [Atom plans to be UK's first all-digital bank](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/apr/09/atom-digital-bank-metro-first-direct)

Although this isn't recent news, I only came across it relatively recently. Apparently the new bank will be headed by Anthony Thomson, founder and former chairman of Metro Bank, and Mark Mullen, who was CEO of First Direct.

It sounds as if it has _some_ of the same goals as the bank/credit union idea that we worked on earlier this year. {by james-mead}


### [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/)

A fast text processor & publishing toolchain for converting [AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) to HTML5, DocBook & more. I've tended to use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) rather than AsciiDoc as my [lightweight markup language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language) of choice, but coming across this Ruby gem has made me wonder whether AsciiDoc might be the better choice in some situations. {by james-mead}


### [Choose one: Feature Toggles vs Authorisation](http://code.joejag.com/2014/feature-toggles-vs-authorisation.html)

This points out that both [Feature Toggles](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html) and [Authorisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization) could make use of the same underlying implementation. I hadn't considered that before. {by james-mead}


### [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/)

I thoroughly enjoyed [Sam Aaron](http://sam.aaron.name/) and [Xavier Riley](http://xavierriley.co.uk/)'s inspirational LRUG presentation: [Live Coding in the Classroom](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5809-live-coding-in-the-classroom). I can see that the rapid feedback provided by Sonic Pi's _live coding_ development environment would be really powerful in engaging children in learning how to program.

The idea of music as test/code to be shared and collaborated on via GitHub is also really interesting. {by james-mead}


### [Matter and Form makes Affordable 3D Scanner](http://3dprintingindustrynews.com/matter-form-makes-affordable-3d-scanner/)

Perhaps we can combine this with our CubeX 3D printer (on loan from [Makie](http://mymakie.com/)) to make a [Star Trek-style replicator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicator_(Star_Trek)). {by james-mead}

Week 305
========

[James][] and I spent 4 days at [FutureLearn][] and Wednesday at GFR HQ.

## FutureLearn

* James and I picked up our security passes at the beginning of the week. Which means that we no longer have to bug people to go to the toilet :-)

* I cleared out a bit of a backlog of errors in [Honeybadger][] and we discussed how we were going to keep on top of these errors in future.

* I saw a preview of the [UX talk that Lucy, Dereck and Alla were giving at UAL][fl-ux-talk]. I really enjoyed it and it sounds as though it was well recieved.

* I spent quite a while working on AWS IAM permissions. It took a long time to get my head around what we had in place before I could move it to version control and start making changes.

* We finished the week with sprint review (I can't believe we've been there two weeks already!) followed by beers to say goodbye to [Barry McGee][]. If you're looking for a great front end developer then I can certainly recommend Barry.

## GFR

* We spent Wednesday at GFR HQ and were unexpectedly joined in the office by [Tom T][], [Tom W][] and [Jase][]. I'm not sure it was the most productive day we've ever had but it was definitely fun. We finished it with some post-work beers at the [Horse and Groom][]. Just like the good old times :-)

* James did a great job of upgrading our Linode instance to Ruby 2.1.4, now that the [Brightbox packages][] are available.

* James started moving content from our GitHub business wiki to our website. Checkout our instructions explaining [how to submit our annual return][] for an example of the sort of thing we've been documenting on our wiki, and what we're hoping to move to our website.

* We started working out what we're going to need to do so that we're ready for the end of the lease on our current office. Sad times.

Until next time, folks.

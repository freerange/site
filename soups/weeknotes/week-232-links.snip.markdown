### [Re-appropriating tools for Pair Programming: The keyboard and mouse](http://salfreudenberg.wordpress.com/2013/06/22/re-appropriating-tools-for-pair-programming-the-keyboard-and-mouse/)

Some people I've [paired](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PairProgramming) with like to have *two* keyboards and *two* mice, but I've always thought that this misses the point - the idea is one person is driving (tactical) and the other is navigating (strategic), so there's only ever any need for one of each. Anyway, I found it interesting to read about some research in this area. {by james-mead}


### [Bats: the Bash Automated Testing System](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats)

I came across this [TAP](http://testanything.org/)-compliant testing framework for [bash](http://www.bash.org/). I think it's pretty neat - each test case is just a function with a description. {by james-mead}

* Cancelled December monthly drinks, because the date falls between Xmas and New Year.
* Organise company day out in December 2016: Thu 08 Dec - visit to Chris & Amy's boat. Plan to make this a quarterly event with the idea of getting away from the day-to-day stuff and do something fun, hopefully giving ourselves the space to do some more big-picture thinking about the company. The next occurrence will be 1st March 2017.

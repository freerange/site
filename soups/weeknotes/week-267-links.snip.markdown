### [Rise of the IndieWeb - Amber Case - FutureTalks (45min video)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au4bHb5twF4)

[Amber Case](http://caseorganic.com/) does a great job of explaining the timeline of events that have led us to the web we currently inhabit; in which we're happy for our identities to be owned by big corporations and in which it's so much easier to consume than create. I'm still only viewing the [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) movement from the sidelines but it really resonates with some of my past toy projects and I hope to get more actively involved. {by chris-roos}

### [Why are people bored with blogging?](http://scripting.com/2014/02/20/whyArePeopleBoredWithBlogging.html)

[Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/) suggests an answer to his question in this post:

> It just occurred to me why that is. The blogging tools developers aren't giving the users anything new and/or interesting to do. 

While that might be the case at the moment, I do think there's some interesting work going on, with Dave's own [Fargo outliner](http://fargo.io/docs/whatIsFargo.html) and all the [projects being built by the IndieWeb community](http://indiewebcamp.com/Projects). Exciting times, I'd say. {by chris-roos}

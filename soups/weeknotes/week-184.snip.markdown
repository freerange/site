Week 184 - James, James, Chris & Tom say.....thanks Tim
-------------------------------------------------------
This week we had a meeting. A big meeting. A meeting to again explore what we as a company want to do.

So what did we decide?  The answer is a few things.  First, that we've not been talking to each other enough.  With half of us working on [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk) on any given day, we're seldom together as a group.  We miss out not just on formal discussions, but as importantly, on the eavesdropping and curiosity that happens when you work in an office together.  So from next week, we're going to spend each Tuesday all working in [our office in Shoreditch](http://gofreerange.com#address-etc).  We'll also go out for a drink or meal each month, because sometimes the best ideas are forged in pubs.

The other main thing we discussed is how to make more progress on non-client work.  We're proud of the work we've done on [hashblue](https://hashblue.com), [chromaroma](http://chromaroma.com) and now [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk) but we'd also like to get more momentum behind our own projects.  To do that we need more focus.  Working in the same location weekly will help, and while we're all together we're going to have a short meeting about what we've done and what we're doing for Go Free Range.  Talking more regularly about how we're working towards our goals should help us meet them.

In the land of [gov.uk](https://gov.uk) things are proceeding nicely.  Now that specialist guidance is looking good, we've been working towards linking it more closely with the more mainstream [gov.uk](https://gov.uk) content.  It should be easy to move from a guide written for specialists to simpler, more general advice and vice-versa.  The same goes for searching.  We also have [New Relic](https://newrelic.com) monitoring up and running, so we can see and respond to performance problems quickly.

Right, that's all for this week.  I'm off to aimlessly flick between 24 channels of sport, many of which I don't understand.  Until next time,

Tom

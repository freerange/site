Week 529
========

Morning folks,

Both projects we've been working on came to an end this week: [Ben][ben-griffiths] and [James][james-mead] finished their work with [Ctrl Group][ctrl-group] and [Chris][chris-lowis] and I finished our work on the [Modern Slavery Registry][modern-slavery-registry] for the [BHRRC][bhrrc]. Both Ctrl Group and BHHRC seemed pleased with what we managed to do in the relatively short time we had.

We spent the rest of the week on a variety of things:

* Spoke to a charity that were wondering whether they should switch from WordPress to some bespoke software. We advised against it given that it wouldn't really help solve their most pressing problem, and that it would incur ongoing maintenance costs.

* Met [Raising IT][raising-it] to learn how they've been getting on since Chris spent some time with them last year.

* Met with a [designer][graphicmaker] to chat about a potential collaboration on [Mission Patch][mission-patch].

* Made some small changes to our Mission Patch Twitter advertising campaign to see whether it makes any difference.

* Created mission patches to celebrate various [historic][mission-patch-bbc-colour] and [current][mission-patch-int-womens-day] events and scheduled them to be tweeted.

* Announced [Mission Patch on Hacker News][hacker-news-mission-patch]. It received a couple of positive comments and a useful tip about how we can avoid polluting the browser history.

* Had a conversation with someone interested in our branded mission-patch.com offering.

* Held our monthly drinks at [The Old Fountain][old-fountain] on Wednesday.

* Held our quarterly away day on Friday where we focussed on discussing business development opportunities before spending an enjoyable hour or so at [Novelty Automation][novelty-automation].

* Announced our [imminent availability][available-to-hire] in various places and had a couple of positive responses. We're very interested in [hearing from you][contact-us] if you have a project you think we can help with.

Until next time.

-- Chris

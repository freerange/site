Week 856
========

Week beginning Monday, 9th June 2025.

[James][james-mead] was away this week, camping on the [Isles of Scilly][silly]. Meanwhile Chris, Seb and I continued working on [Experience CS][experience-cs] the computer science education platform we're building with the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

We're tackling a couple of chunkier backend pieces of work this week. One is an integration between the site and [CrowdIn][crowdin], a SaaS for creating translations of website content. Our colleague gave a great demo of how he and his team use CrowdIn to translate sites at the Foundation which helped me to understand the big picture. [Seb][seb-jacobs] has been working on the integration. It uses Github as an intermediary so that changes to the Rails localisation files and the database content can be synchronised back-and-forth between the two systems.

Chris and I were pairing on the integration between Experience CS and the Foundation's learning management tool. This work will allow teachers to find a scratch project they'd like their students to work on, assign that to their class and then "collect in" the work of the students to see their progress.

Around all that I spent a tiring night in the local A&E after my foot swelled up suddenly as a result of falling over at a "Dad's sports day". I was happy to get the all-clear, nothing hurt but pride, but it's really thrown my sleep out this week!

## Links

A few links we've shared with each other on our internal Slack channel.

- [docs.coop](https://docs.coop/) is a new "Co-operatively hosted open source document editing" tool from our friends at Autonomic.
- [milkdown](https://milkdown.dev/) is a framework for building markdown editors.
- [scrappy](https://pontus.granstrom.me/scrappy/) "make little apps for you and your friends"

And we continue to navigate the hype/excitement/fear of "AI"

- [Trusting your own judgement on AI is a huge risk](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2025/trusting-your-own-judgement-on-ai/): "Our only recourse as a field is the same as with naturopathy: scientific studies by impartial researchers."
- [Why Open Source Maintainers Thrive in the LLM Era](https://mikemcquaid.com/why-open-source-maintainers-thrive-in-the-llm-era/): "The optimal path in 2025 is to embrace LLM tools, balancing pragmatic optimism with healthy skepticism regarding dramatic claims from either side."

Have lovely weekends,

-- Chris

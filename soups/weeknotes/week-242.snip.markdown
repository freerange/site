Week 242
========

Afternoon everybody peeps. I hope you're all well.

It's been another quiet(ish) week on the GFR front. Tom's still away, James A was only back on Tuesday (and is still in the You Ess of Aye with their crazy timezones) and James M is off today.

We're continuing to spend most of our time working with FutureLearn, trying to balance new feature requests with making sure the site remains robust enough for the growing number of users we're trialling it with.

On the GFR front, while we didn't make any more progress with the documentation of our development process (the excitement of doing our VAT return took too much out of us), I did manage to make a start on documenting some of our git practices. I've seen a few guides that tell you how to use git but not so many that really explain why you'd use it in that way, which is what I'm really interested in.

And with that, I'll love and leave y'all.

Week 289 - Interesting links
============================

### [Robot With Long Finger Wants to Touch Your iPhone Apps](http://www.wired.com/2013/08/tapster/)

[Jason Huggins][], author of [Selenium][] and co-founder of [SauceLabs][], has designed [Tapsterbot][] a 3D-printable robot with open-source hardward & [software][] which is capable of [mimicing human gestures][] on touch screens. The idea is that the Selenium-compatible robot can be used to automate acceptance testing of software on touch screen devices. I love the idea of it! {by james-mead}


### [Doing the hard work to make things simple](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/07/28/doing-the-hard-work-to-make-things-simple/)

Although I'm not convinced we need to be making it [easier for landlords to evict tenants][] (!), I like the way the team at [MoJ Digital Services][] have chosen to [iteratively improve a small part][] of a large legacy system. {by james-mead}


### [When TDD Doesn't Matter](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/when-tdd-doesnt-matter/797644973601702)

In this article, [Kent Beck][] suggests that there are three important dimensions in characterizing feedback for a programming decision: scope, clarity, and frequency. He goes on to explain why he finds [TDD][] useful...

> TDD is a little box in this big space of feedback, the combination of expressing binary expectations, expressing them as tests, and receiving feedback every few seconds about whether those expectations are being met.
>
> This seems to me to be a sweet spot in the feedback space. You don't get perfect information, but you get pretty good information at a reasonable cost and quickly enough that you can a) fix problems quickly and b) learn not to make the same mistake again.

This seems like a useful way to decide when it's worth doing TDD. {by james-mead}


### [A Boring Conference - Videos](http://boringconference.com/2014/07/13/videos/)

[James Ward][] has published some more videos from the conference I attended [back in June][]. Of this selection, I probably enjoyed [Ali Coote][]'s talk about [operating an ice-cream van][] the most. {by james-mead}

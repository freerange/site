Week 850
========

Week beginning Monday, 28th April 2025.

We've been enjoying some beautiful weather here in the south of England this week ðŸŒž. Fortunately my windowless office means that I don't know what I've been missing ðŸ˜­.

We've all spent the week working on [Experience CS][experience-cs]:

- [Seb][seb-jacobs]'s been wrangling various [scratch-gui][scratch-gui] branches to get them into a sensible state.
- [Chris][chris-lowis] has been building out the CMS functionality that will power the curriculum content on the site.
- [James][james-mead] has been connecting all the bits together to allow us to store Scratch assets in an S3 bucket, including solving a hard-to-debug problem with [Sentry][sentry] headers, HTTP redirects and [CORS][cors].
- And I've been digging into scratch-gui to work out how best to hook into the various state changes so that we can communicate them back to the user.

In other news:

James spotted, and promptly fixed, a bug in [Mission Patch][mission-patch] that prevented an order being sent to [Diginate][diginate] as expected.

Happy International Workers' day, and [happy birthday to our fellow cooperators at We Are Open][wao-birthday].

We were sad to learn the [fate of Gadz cafe][gadz] where we'd often enjoy lunch when working at [SPACE4][space4].

We're all off for another long weekend due to the early May bank holiday ðŸ¥³.

Until next time.

-- Chris

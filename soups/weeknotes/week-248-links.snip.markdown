### [The Rails Testing Pyramid](http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2013/10/09/rails-testing-pyramid/)

A few weeks back I wrote about [rebalancing the testing pyramid](/week-229#rebalancing-the-testing-pyramid). This article echoes some of the same sentiments and talks about making acceptance tests based on user journeys rather than individual features. {by james-mead}


### [British Antarctic Survey Halley Research Station (video)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDIi7rP_WBA)

Although I believe the work took much longer than expected and a lot of science stopped while the work was going on, the new Antarctic research station at Halley is certainly an impressive sight. {by james-mead}


### [Throw away Photoshop and be true to your medium](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/03/29/breaking-down-walls-designing-in-browser/)

There's been some interest in the idea of in-browser design on our [current project](https://www.futurelearn.com/). I stumbled across this article by [James Weiner](https://twitter.com/jamesweiner) which makes some useful points.


### [Mocoso](https://github.com/frodsan/mocoso)

A Ruby mocking & stubbing library made in Peru and sharing the sobriquet of [Joel Chippindale](https://github.com/mocoso), the Tech Lead on our current project. Note that I've not actually looked at any of the code! {by james-mead}

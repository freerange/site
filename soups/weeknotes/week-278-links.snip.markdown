Week 278 - Interesting links
============================

### [Change the visibility of your Gists Â· GitHub](https://github.com/blog/1837-change-the-visibility-of-your-gists)

This is a great improvement - I've certainly wanted to be able to convert a gist from private to public in the past. {by chris-roos}


### [Boldore likes bouldering (roll with it) - Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com/boldore-likes-bouldering-roll-with-it/)

I can imagine this coming in handy (I've certainly seen other workarounds in the past to achieve something similar). Set `Capybara.asset_host = '<your-development-server>'` to have `save_and_open_page` open the temporary html page with links to your sites assets. {by chris-roos}


### [Accept on HTML file upload; Useful attribute on input tag - jeena.net](https://jeena.net/posts/98)

Although apparently not universally supported, this certainly sounds useful. Setting the `accept` attribute on a file input element prompts certain browsers to only allow the selection of suitable files. {by chris-roos}


### [Mailpin: Publish an email as a web page by Mailp.in](http://mailp.in/c8cN1BEb)

This is very similar to an idea I had a few years back. I even bought permailink.co.uk (geddit!?) to host it but never actually got around to making anything of it. I was interested to see that at least one person still thinks this sort of thing is useful. {by chris-roos}


### [East London from the air (OFFICIAL VIDEO) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2ew201DhpI)

I love this video of East London. Partly because I recognise quite a few of the locations, and partly because of the use of the camera drones. Via [Londonist](http://londonist.com/2014/04/a-superheros-view-of-east-london.php). {by chris-roos}


### [London In Motion - A Short Timelapse/Hyperlapse video on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/91869269)

Another beautiful video via [Londonist](http://londonist.com/2014/04/london-in-motion-a-new-timelapse-of-the-capital.php). This time a hyperlapse/timelapse video of London. Enjoy! {by chris-roos}


### [The DHH Problem](http://codon.com/the-dhh-problem)

A light-hearted, but heartfelt lightning talk by [Tom Stuart](https://twitter.com/tomstuart) at [Scottish Ruby Conference 2014](http://2014.scottishrubyconference.com/) containing an important message for Rubyists everywhere. {by james-mead}


### [RawGit](http://rawgit.com/)

Allows you to serve up your raw files directly from GitHub with proper Content-Type headers and even via a CDN if you so wish. {by james-mead}


###[Lotus](http://lotusrb.org/)

An open-source modular web framework for Ruby (more objects, fewer DSLs, no monkey patching) [mentioned by Tom Stuart](https://twitter.com/tomstuart/status/466964841174159360). {by james-mead}


### [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/)

This unit-testing framework which sits on top of [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) looks like it has some interesting features. I'd also like to find out more about one of its dependencies, [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom). {by james-mead}


### [Making Your Code Citable](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)

Unfortunately sharing code in academia is the exception not the rule. Hopefully issuing [DOI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier)s for GitHub repositories removes one of the main barriers to doing this. {by james-mead}


### [Peer Review as a Service: It's not about the journal](http://theoj.org/)

In this article the [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/) gang write about an open online academic journal they'v started to build on top of the [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/). It's a shame that they haven't finished it, but I applaud them for open-sourcing their work so far. {by james-mead}

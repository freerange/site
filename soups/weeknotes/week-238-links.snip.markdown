### [The story behind XKCD's Time comic](http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/08/xkcd-time-comic/)

I didn't have the patience to follow the [Time comic](http://www.xkcd.com/1190/) as it unfolded, a frame every 30 minutes, but thankfully patience is no longer required. I had no idea it was this involved and complex; it's the kind of thing I'd love to make. {by james-adam}


### [Lego Turing Machine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYw2ewoO6c4)

Having just finished [Tom Stuart](http://codon.com)'s great [Understanding Computation](http://computationbook.com), it was fun to come across this video of a physical Turing machine, made using Lego Mindstorms and a fairly ingenious "infinite tape". If you're having any trouble imagining what Tom describes, take a look at this. {by james-adam}


### [1 weird tip for understanding those "1 weird tip" adverts](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/07/how_one_weird_trick_conquered_the_internet_what_happens_when_you_click_on.single.html)

If you haven't come across a '1 weird tip' advert, you haven't been using the internet recently. This Slate article explains what they are, who is behind them, why the exist and ultimately what those weird tips are. Spoiler: they're codswallop. {by james-adam}


### [The Future of Programming](http://worrydream.com/dbx/)

There are so many things to like about this Bret Victor talk (I'm a huge fan, as [I've said elsewhere](http://interblah.net/inventing-on-principle)), but even if you take nothing away from the content (but you will), the delivery and the fact that he stays in character the whole time is really priceless. I won't say more, because I don't want to spoil it. Go watch. {by james-adam}


### [Mailpile](http://www.mailpile.is/)

This is an [Indiegogo](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mailpile-taking-e-mail-back)-backed open-source self-hosted Gmail replacement. I'm hoping that [Chris Indieweb Roos](/chris-roos) will try this out for me, but so far he's been showing a strange reluctance to self-host *other people's* software. {by james-mead}


### [The Phoenix Project](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Phoenix-Project-Business-ebook/dp/B00AZRBLHO)

This novel about IT, DevOps, and "Helping Your Business Win" showed up quite a bit in my Twitter feed recently and sounds intriguing, so I've ordered a copy. I'll try to let you know what it's like. {by james-mead}


### [Extreme Startup Game](/extreme-startup-game)

I enjoyed reading [James'](/james-adam) account of our attempts at this game which [Rob Chatley](http://chatley.com/) ran at GFRHQ recently. I'm only _ever so slightly_ embarrassed that [Rob D](https://twitter.com/robd) and I didn't write any tests!

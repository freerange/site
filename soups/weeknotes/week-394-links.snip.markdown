Week 394 - Interesting links
============================

### [Missing Maps](http://www.missingmaps.org/)

My friend, Nick, who works at the humanitarian mapping charity, [Map Action](http://www.mapaction.org/), told me about the Missing Maps project. It's an open, collaborative effort to improve [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) in areas where humanitarian organisations are working. In particular, I really like the idea of their volunteer-organised [Mapathons](http://www.missingmaps.org/host/). {by james-mead}

### [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)

The language-agnostic parts of the [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) were split out to form the Jupyter Notebook. This is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Back in [Show & Tell 6](/show-and-tell-6), Ben mentioned that there was Ruby support for the IPython Notebook. This now takes the form of a [Ruby kernel](https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby) for the Jupyter Notebook. I recently had a play with this and, although it was a bit painful getting it installed, I was pretty impressed with its capabilities. {by james-mead}

### [Enspiral](http://enspiral.com/)

[John Bevan](http://www.bevangelist.uk/) of the [We Are Open cooperative](http://weareopen.coop/) told me about Enspiral which is a network of social enterprises based in New Zealand. The origins of the organisation were in the [Occupy movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement). A few years ago I remember [Josef Davies-Coates](https://twitter.com/jdaviescoates) telling us about the online collaboration tool, [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/), which is one of Enspiral's ventures, so it was interesting to be reminded of it and see where it's got to. {by james-mead}

### [Windyty](https://www.windyty.com)

This is a weather forecasting website with very pretty animations of e.g. wind speed & direction, and wave height & direction. [VentuSky](http://www.ventusky.com/) is another similar website. {by james-mead}

Week 419
========

[James][james-mead] spent the week skiing so I was left to fend for myself. Not to worry though, I kept busy with some GFR admin, [Mocha][mocha-rb] development and [CoTech][co-tech] involvement.

## GDS

We received and signed our contracts from [Digital Gurus][digital-gurus] so we're all set to start work at [GDS][gds] in week 420.

## GFR

### Time tracking

I spent a while investigating how to record the time we spend working on regular admin tasks. I tried some different apps that integrate with [Trello][trello] before deciding that it probably makes sense to continue using [FreeAgent][free-agent] but to record our time at a finer level of detail.

### Are we a co-op?

Our website says that we're a co-op yet neither of us knew whether we could legitimately defend that statement. I spent some time investigating cooperatives and collectives and came to the conclusion that we satisfy the somewhat loose definition of a [worker cooperative][worker-cooperative]. I made a number of notes but they're in our internal wiki so I can't link to them from here unfortunately.

### Monthly drinks

I was joined by [Ben G][ben-griffiths] and [Chris L][chris-lowis] for our monthly drinks on Wednesday. We started in the [Lord Nelson][lord-nelson] but that soon filled up so we moved on to [The Crown][the-crown]. I think I was last in The Crown during my [Reevoo][reevoo] days (maybe about 8 years ago) so it was good to visit and see that it hasn't changed a great deal.

## Mocha

I continued to work on my [spike to refactor `ClassMethod` and friends][mocha-pr-269] but got sidetracked when I found another class (`ModuleMethod`) that I need to consider when making my changes.

## CoTech

I visited [The Amersham Arms][amersham-arms] in New Cross and paid the deposit to hire the venue for our CoTech social during [Open 2017][open-2017].

We agreed to test using [Cobudget][cobudget] within CoTech to collectively put some money toward a bar tab for the aforementioned social. While a relatively trivial use of Cobudget, it should hopefully help us understand how it works and how we might use it for slightly more substantial projects.

Until next time.

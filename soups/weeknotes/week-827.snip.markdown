Week 827
========

Week beginning Monday, 18th November 2024.

[Chris][chris-roos] and I continued to work on the prototype we started [last week](/week-826). There's a number of things our client is concerned about the feasibility of, so our spike is helping to give them confidence that these problems are solvable.

We're working with React, something that we've used a lot but quite intermittently. We've been looking at the [useReducer](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer) hook to encapsulate many of the state changes in a single place, and remove some of the "business logic" from the other components. This feels like an improvement and will make it easier to add new features. As usual when working on React code we long for some [Rails-like conventions](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v8.0/layouts_and_rendering.html#rendering-by-default-convention-over-configuration-in-action) to tell us how to name things and where to store files. We've come up with a few of our own, such as naming top-level "page" components `FooNew`, `FooShow` or `FooIndex`.

After suffering with Slack "huddles" for pair-programming we remembered that [Pop](https://pop.com/home) exists, and importantly (unlike Tuple) has a maintained Linux client. Pop seems to work great, has good audio quality, a shared whiteboard for sketching, and the ability to take control of the other person's keyboard. We're pleased with it so far.

Have a great weekend!

Week 314
========

This week was a bit of a write-off. [Chris][] was still on holiday and the cough that I'd been fighting off since the New Year finally caught up with me. I was only fit to do anything for a couple of days - pairing with [Chris L][] and [Melinda][] at Futurelearn on Tuesday and taking care of [GFR][] admin on Wednesday.

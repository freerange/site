### [The Simpsons' secret formula: it's written by maths geeks](http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/22/the-simpsons-secret-formula-maths-simon-singh)

I loved reading about how David Cohen generated a near-miss solution to Fermat's equation and included it in the show. {by james-mead}


### [Peachy Printer - The world's first $100 3D Printer](http://www.3ders.org//articles/20130921-the-peachy-printer-the-world-first-100-dollar-3d-printer-scanner.html)

I think the simplicity of this is ingenious. It uses a photo-lithographic process whereby a controlled beam of light cures light sensitive resin into hard objects. A laser beam moves along the X and Y axes to create the shape of the object, while using a drip system to control the level of the resin on the Z axis. You can obtain a kit by [backing it on Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/117421627/the-peachy-printer-the-first-100-3d-printer-and-sc). {by james-mead}


### [Carousel-Based Web Design](http://www.the-haystack.com/2013/09/22/carousel-based-web-design/)

I feel a bit naughty including this, but it did make me chuckle and I think it does serve some purpose. {by james-mead} (via [Neil Williams](https://twitter.com/neillyneil))


### [ActiveRecord: Enhanced Query Objects](http://hasghari.github.io/2013/09/15/active-record-enhanced-query-objects.html)

Being able to extend an `ActiveRecord::Relation` object with custom scopes looks like a useful trick. {by james-mead}

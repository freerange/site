### [Tom Armitage: Weeks 183-186](http://tomarmitage.com/2016/07/25/worknotes-weeks-183-186/)

Tom's weeknotes include a paragraph on the struggle of keeping them up to date:

> I’m a little concerned when weeknotes slip – sometimes, it’s just because I’m busy, and after a long week the idea of writing them out of office hours isn’t always super-appealing. For me, the utility is not just the act of doing them, but looking back on them later. So there’s still value to handing in work late, as it were. I’m going to try to get back into some better patterns in the coming weeks, but balancing reporting/documentation with Doing The Work is important, and the former is taking priority a little at the moment. Busy is good, though, and hopefully that’ll continue.

We've currently got a bit of a backlog of unwritten week notes and it made me feel slightly better to realise that we're not alone in our struggle to keep them up to date! {by chris-roos}

Week 423
========

_Note that I'm writing these notes about 4 months late which is why they're in summary form._

* [Chris Lowis][] joined Go Free Range - yay! Monday was his first day. We appointed him as a fellow director and we plan to sell him some of our shares at the end of the month to make us all equal shareholders. It's great to be growing again!

* We worked at TOG Bloomsbury on Monday & Tuesday, at TOG Tottenham Court Road on Wednesday, the Barbican Cinema Benugo on Thursday, and from home on Friday. Chris R headed off for a long (birthday) weekend in Bath on Friday.

* On Wednesday we had a follow-up meeting with a prospective client.

* Chris L's new laptop arrived on Thursday - woot!

* We all spent quite a bit of the week getting Chris L setup on various systems, but we tried hard to document the process as much as possible, so it should be easier next time.

* We also spent a lot of the week filling in a proposal form for a potential new client project. We found it pretty hard-going, but finished it just in time for the submission deadline on Thursday.

* We invoiced our fellow CoTech coops for the Amersham Arms bar tab which they had agreed to crowd-fund.

* I started investigating a mistake that had been made in setting my [NI category letter][ni-category-letter]. Unfortunately this had gone un-noticed for well over a year.

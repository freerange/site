Week 147
========


Some ideas...

- Jase conversation with O2 guy
- Cleared out the office thanks to Hackney Council, maybe put this pic inline? http://instagr.am/p/TStvP/
- (we should really pick a date for an office warming soon.)
- James A went to RubyBiz, talked a bit about company insurance (boring), cucumber (we've independently come to some similar conclusions as Chris Parsons did), met a fan of #blue, was surprised to discover that people still don't 100% get that we're all co-ownered and all share the business stuff as well as development
- Dealing with the scrum in GovUK's new office


Stuff from last week that we could try to expand on:

- Chris & James' meeting with Expl. Is there anything useful to be generalised from that? Perhaps that it's not enough to have the idea for a mechanic and then trying to find something to apply it to? I dunno. Maybe.
- Discussion about if/when/how to bring another person on board. I think there's definitely interesting stuff in this
  - bringing on an equal partner
  - training up juniors
    (those perhaps not being mutually exclusive)
  - how to figure out if people are a good fit
  - working for GFR being an "investment in the company" rather than a bill-as-much-as-you-can freelancer gig
  - other stuff?
- Realising we need a bit more structure in the prioritisation stuff with GovUK

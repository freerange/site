============

Open your mind, and let us pour in a generous ladel of delicious Interesting Broth!

### [The Management-Free Organisation](http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/the_managementfree_organization/)

You've probably already seen this [via John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/03/25/adams-management); it's obvious within [GFR](/) that if we didn't have good people, there's no way we could operate without someone cracking the whip.

However, I'm curious about point 3 in Scott Adams's decision process ("*The smartest choice becomes obvious to all*"). In my experience, this isn't as trivial as Scott makes it sound. The smartest choice often *isn't* obvious, and it's quite easy for subjective influences and personal interests to weigh heavily in any decision-making process. {by james-adam}

### [Hashtags considered harmful](http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/03/hashtags-considered-harmful/)

> I believe hashtags are aesthetically damaging. I believe a tweet free of hashtags is more pleasing to the eye, more easily consumed, and thus more likely to be retweeted (which is a proven way of growing your audience). I believe for every person who stumbles upon your tweet via hashtag, you’re likely turning off many more who are put off by hashtag overuse. We need not banish the hashtag, but let’s start putting more thought into when we’re using it.

Perhaps this lends weight to the motivation behind [HeyList!](http://heyli.st)... {by james-adam}

### [Helper Testing in Rails 3](http://blog.costan.us/2010/08/helper-testing-in-rails-3.html)

I hadn't realised that you could call `render` and subsequently use `assert_select` in `ActionView::TestCase` tests. I think in the past, we've wrapped assert_select so that we can pass it a string. {by chris-roos}

### [The UK Backlogs Agency?](http://fullfact.org/factchecks/ukba_backlog_24_years-28852)

Some background to the claims that it'll take 24 years to clear UKBA's backlog. {by chris-roos}

### [How the Maker of TurboTax Fought Free, Simple Tax Filing](http://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-maker-of-turbotax-fought-free-simple-tax-filing)

There are obviously two sides to this story and I have no idea whether it'd be better or worse for the public if the IRS prepared their tax returns for them; but... my gut feel is that Intuit are lobbying to protect their own interests, rather than those of the public. {by chris-roos}

### [GOV.UK is going Worldwide](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/03/25/gov-uk-is-going-worldwide/)

GDS have launched the worldwide section of Inside Government that we, at GFR were involved with earlier this year. It's always good to be reminded about the scale of the project we've been involved in. {by chris-roos}

### [Introducing Learn Prime: Subscription access to everything we teach.](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/46249965247/introducing-learn-prime-subscription-access-to)

$99 a month initially sounded really high but I wouldn't be surprised if it's comparable to what larger companies might pay for employee training. {by chris-roos}

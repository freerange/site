### [The Management-Free Organisation](http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/the_managementfree_organization/)

You've probably already seen this [via John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/03/25/adams-management); it's obvious within [GFR](/) that if we didn't have good people, there's no way we could operate without someone cracking the whip.

However, I'm curious about point 3 in Scott Adams's decision process ("*The smartest choice becomes obvious to all*"). In my experience, this isn't as trivial as Scott makes it sound. The smartest choice often *isn't* obvious, and it's quite easy for subjective influences and personal interests to weigh heavily in any decision-making process. {by james-adam}

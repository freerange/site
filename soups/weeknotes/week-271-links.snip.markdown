Week 271 - Interesting links
============================

### [Be amazed by emails, again | Front](http://frontapp.com/)

This was mentioned by [James A](http://lazyatom.com/) and looks like the sort of thing we were trying to find a while back to help respond to emails that come to the group address. {by chris-roos}


### [Soundslice | Living sheet music and guitar tablature](http://www.soundslice.com/)

This was mentioned by [Chris Lowis](http://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/). It looks like a really interesting way of learning music by playing along to these interactive song sheets.

They also have [transcribed music videos](http://www.soundslice.com/completed/) that you can play along with. {by chris-roos}


### [London Street Views 1840 Homepage](http://crowd.museumoflondon.org.uk/lsv1840/)

> This website displays the elevation views of 35 of the guides (from the West End) and we would like your help in transcribing the business directories. Help us create the first searchable business directory of early Victorian London that includes street views.

This is a great idea. It uses a streetview-like experience to display these elevations from 1840! {by chris-roos}


### [Annotator](http://annotatorjs.org/)

An open-source JavaScript library that can be added to any web page to make it annotatable. There's also a bookmarklet available. There's a hosted backend, [AnnotateIt](http://annotateit.org/), or you can [host your own storage](http://docs.annotatorjs.org/en/latest/storage.html).

### [web-vmstats](https://github.com/joewalnes/web-vmstats)

A tiny application that streams the output of `vmstat` over a web socket using [websocketd](https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd) and charts them using [SmoothieCharts](https://github.com/joewalnes/web-vmstats). I thought this was pretty neat. {by james-mead}

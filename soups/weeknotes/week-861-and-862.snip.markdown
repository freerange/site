Week 861 & 862
==============

Two weeks beginning Monday, 14th July 2025.

Schools have now broken up for the Summer here in the UK which means that we'll be at slightly reduced capacity for the next few weeks as we take annual leave and juggle childcare and work.

We're continuing to work on [Experience CS][] with a focus on making all the project content translatable before some schools in the US go back in August.

Aside from translations we've been working on:

- isolating our Experience CS specific changes to [scratch-gui][] from those that can potentially be pushed upstream
- multi-step instructions for Scratch projects
- providing zip files of all lesson resources to save teachers from having to view/download them all separately
- squashing some N+1 queries with the help of [Prosopite][]
- finally fixing a long standing problem that was preventing dependabot from updating our npm packages (it's apparently due a [known problem with npm < 10.5.0 and corepack][dependabot-problem])
- documenting various aspects of the project setup in preparation for us finishing at the end of August

We also heard back about a couple of possible projects to learn that they've decided not to go with us so we're currently looking for work from early September. [Get in touch][] if you have something you think we can help with.

Week 411
========

I think we both struggled with motivation a bit during week 411. It's a problem we've experienced before when we're splitting our time between lots of smaller tasks rather than having a main thing that we're focussing on.

## Business development

We met Jack from GDS to talk about the practicalities of doing some more work with them. We were hoping to be able to use the Digital Outcomes and Specialists framework but it sounds as though that might not be feasible; or at least not in the short term.

We started going through the application process for Digital Outcomes and Specialists 2. I ended up wasting quite a lot of time trying to compare the various contracts between the two versions before giving up. The contracts only appear to be available as PDFs which makes comparing them _way_ harder than it should/could be. I even started creating Markdown versions of the contracts to make comparison easier (I figure this would be useful to others too) before deciding that it wasn't the best use of my time.

## IFTTT

We're continuing to use IFTTT to automatically create Trello cards for a number of recurring tasks we have set-up in a Google Calendar. This week we moved the small number of recurring tasks from our main calendar to a "GFR Tasks" specific calendar. This makes things a little simpler as we no longer have to rely on being able to search for the tasks we want to create cards for.

## Collaborative Inbox

We spent quite a while experimenting with the Google Groups Collaborative Inbox. We have some shared conventions in place that helps us share responsibility for handling the emails we receive. This relies on us remembering how the process works and we thought that using something like Collaborative Inbox might makes things less confusing. Unfortunately, that doesn't really seem to be the case.

We played with the idea of using the web interface as our primary method of interacting with emails. Unfortunately this didn't work quite as expected. Replying to an email from the group results in the email being sent to the group and cc'd to the original author. We think this would be confusing for people that don't know they're interacting with a group rather than a single email account.

TODO: Expand on this!

## Hookline

We had an urgent email on Friday afternoon stating that the playlists weren't working in the Hookline music app! We soon realised that it was because the credit card registered with GDS had expired. Updating the details had us back up and running immediately. We're now planning to put something in place that helps ensure we're alerted to this problem much sooner in future.

##Â Mocha

James and I spent some time pairing on my pull request that refactors some of the `ClassMethod` and `AnyInstanceMethod` classes. This has been "in progress" for some time so our goal was to work out the minimum work required to get the changes merged. I came away with a list of things to do and hope to get round to them quite soon.

James investigated the problem described in [issue 286][mocha-issue-286] and decided to deprecate the somewhat confusing behaviour. This was all made slightly more complicated by a change on Travis [causing builds against Ruby 1.8.7 to fail][travis-issue-6963]. Once that was worked around James was able to get the tests in his branch working.

## Chess

James did some more work on this on Friday although ran into problems trying to get the board wired up to a bread board.

## Social

We headed to the Calthorpe Arms for our monthly drinks on Wednesday. I've not been there before but really liked the feel of the pub.

Until next time.

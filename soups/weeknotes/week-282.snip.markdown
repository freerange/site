Week 282
========

Having finished our work at [MakieLab][] on Friday, we spent Monday in our office catching our breath before heading off to [FutureLearn][] in the [British Library][] for the rest of the week to hand-over our video-related work to the development team.

We find that the best way to hand over work like this is to [pair program][] on some real user stories and I think this worked pretty well. We also did a presentation to the wider product team to explain how the current solution works and the reasoning behind the decisions that had got us there. Luckily we'd written up a lot of notes as we've gone along, so this was more a case of highlighting some of the more salient points.

Anyway, I hope the FutureLearn folk feel like we've left them in a decent position to pick up where we've left off.

## Show and Tell

Back at GFRHQ on Wednesday evening we ran another [Show and Tell][] session. Luckily our shiny new Mac Mini and [Chromecast][] arrived just in time so that we could involve [James A][] from across the pond via a _live video link_.

First up, [Tom Stuart][] talked about his experience of recording a screencast with Drew Neil of [Vimcasts][] fame. I'm very jealous of how proficient at `vim` Tom has become in recent months, but being recorded working on a problem like this sight-unseen sounded very scary.

He also showed us some of the JavaScript code he's been working on recently with [Nat Buckley][] which was commissioned by [Artangel][]. The commission involves orchestrating a bunch of video and audio assets and they've achieved this using [backbone.js][] custom events and the [WebAudio API][].

Lastly Tom showed us the tool chain he's using to write his upcoming e-book about [writing web apps in Ruby][ruby-web-app-ebook]. I don't remember all the details, but he's [doing something clever][highlight-gist] with Ruby & [Pygments][] to add code syntax highlighting tags to his [DocBook][] markup.

[Chris][] gave us a quick tour of his awesome [Roosmarks][] and [MoneyTracker][] projects, before talking in a bit more detail about his [Thames Time-Lapse][] project. He's been using an old Android phone to capture photos from his flat which overlooks the Thames and then stitching the photos together to make time-lapse videos like [this one which includes a beautiful sunrise][sample-time-lapse-video]. Chris has got some really interesting ideas for things to do with his photos and I'm looking forward to seeing the results!

We then adjourned to [The Fox][] for a few more beers. People seemd to enjoy the evening and we've already planned the next one.

Until next time.

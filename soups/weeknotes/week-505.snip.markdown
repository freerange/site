Week 505
========

I was away on Monday on the last day of my RYA Day Skipper course, sailing in the Solent.

Chris L spent Monday doing some on-site data science consultancy for a client in Shoreditch and I think he had a productive day. Historically we haven't tended to do many short-term consultancy gigs like this one, because of the overheads involved, so it'll be interesting to see how this one pans out.

Chris L was then away at the [Web Audio Conference][] in Berlin for the rest of the week. In case you didn't know, Chris publishes the excellent [Web Audio Weekly newsletter][], so get yourself over there and [subscribe][waw-subscribe]!

Chris R and Ben met up with a potential collaborator who we know from our time at [FutureLearn][]. It's always good to catch up and discuss the possibility of working together.

We held our September Show & Tell event at our office in Whitechapel on Wednesday evening.

That's all, folks!

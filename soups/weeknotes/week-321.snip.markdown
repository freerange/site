Week 321
========

Week 321 was another pretty quiet week for GFR. I was off on Monday and James spent the week skiing in Italy.

Here's what I got up to in James's absence.

* Spent some time going through a contract relating to work that we're hoping to start in the near future. I always struggle reading these sort of things: It takes a lot of effort to concentrate on parsing the legalese.

* Followed up on a meeting James had in [week 317](/week-317#gfr) about the possibility of some work in the future.

* Spent all too long finding content for, and publishing our [week links for week 320](/week-320-links).

* Hosted [Show and Tell 10](/show-and-tell-10).

* Spent a long time going through our Annual Accounts, attempting to satisfy myself that they all made sense before signing off on them.

Until next time.

Week 398
========

_Note that we're writing these notes nearly 6 months late which is why they're in bullet point form._

* Short week due to bank holiday Monday.

* Spent our time working on GFR and Hookline.

* GFR monthly drinks at The Old Salt Quay on Wednesday.

* Contacted various places to find a location for the Show & Tell.

* Continued to think about hiring someone to help with admin aspects of GFR.

* Researched co-working spaces that we might be able to use.

* Hit the 50 task limit in Harmonia which meant we couldn't create anymore!

* Tried to submit data to MISO but failed because the system now fails to recognise our email address as it contains a '+'.

* Upgraded GFR Video to newer version of Rails after reviewing security vulnerabilities.

* Renewed SSL certificate for video.gofreerange.com.

* Investigated why it doesn't appear to be possible to join the Show & Tell email group. Added a note to the web page to explain that it's a known problem.

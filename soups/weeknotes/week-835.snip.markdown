Week 835
========

Week beginning Monday, 13th January 2025.

We've spent the majority of this week continuing to work on our new client project. We're dealing with a large established codebase that's using an old version and style of React, and old versions of build system tooling. Which means we've mostly been spiking into how to get it all working together sensibly. We've managed to get _something_ deployed that people in our team can start playing with but have also made it clear that we're a _very_ long way from having something that's production-ready.

We've continued to use Pop to pair/mob on the project and I've really enjoyed it. So much so that I missed the social aspect when I was working mostly on my own today.

Part of the client project is hosted on Cloudflare Pages and I've been impressed by how straightforward it is to use: it reminds me of the experience of using Heroku for the first time all those years ago.

The combination of the Christmas break and starting this new project means that the work on rubyforge redirects has ground to a halt. I refamiliarised myself with the state of the project this morning and have created some GitHub issues outlining the next steps. I'm hopeful we can get this moving again.

James and I got stuck into some VAT-related "fun" again today in relation to Mission Patch and Jam sales to customers outside the UK. It feels as though it should be conceptually relatively simple but everything seems overly complicated everytime we have to revisit it. I appreciated being able to pair with James to try to make sense of it.

Until next time.

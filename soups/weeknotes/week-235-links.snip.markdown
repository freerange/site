### [Small Build, Big Execution](http://cpprojects.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/small-build-big-execuition.html)

> A rats nest of wires on a breadboard is not a finished project, it is an easily damaged mess.

This is basically the motivation that drove me towards [Printer](/printer) -- I'd made a hacky thing ([Timmy](/timmy)) that ended up being such a hassle to re-assemble when I came back to it, and such a weight on my mind, that I decided to re-build it in such a way that I (or, as it happens, anyone) could come back to it and find a useful artefact.


### [Low End Box](http://www.lowendbox.com/)

I told {l chris-roos,Chris} that I'd dig up this link a few weeks ago, and then totally forgot. The hosting provider we use ([Linode](http://www.linode.com/?r=6f2e7f0dbc623e6d0db13dd153f4b2c57eb09ce2)) is excellent and can supply some pretty powerful machines, with up to 40GB of RAM. However, sometimes the application you want to deploy doesn't really need more than a few hundred megabytes of RAM or access to a lot of processing power. Heroku is one option for those cases, but you can also rent a low-spec VPS for less than Â£2 a month from many different providers; Low End Box provides links to all sorts of options.

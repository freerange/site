### [Small Build, Big Execution](http://cpprojects.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/small-build-big-execuition.html)

> A rats nest of wires on a breadboard is not a finished project, it is an easily damaged mess.

This is basically the motivation that drove me towards [Printer](/printer) -- I'd made a hacky thing ([Timmy](/timmy)) that ended up being such a hassle to re-assemble when I came back to it, and such a weight on my mind, that I decided to re-build it in such a way that I (or, as it happens, anyone) could come back to it and find a useful artefact. {by james-adam}


### [Low End Box](http://www.lowendbox.com/)

I told {l chris-roos,Chris} that I'd dig up this link a few weeks ago, and then totally forgot. The hosting provider we use ([Linode](http://www.linode.com/?r=6f2e7f0dbc623e6d0db13dd153f4b2c57eb09ce2)) is excellent and can supply some pretty powerful machines, with up to 40GB of RAM. However, sometimes the application you want to deploy doesn't really need more than a few hundred megabytes of RAM or access to a lot of processing power. Heroku is one option for those cases, but you can also rent a low-spec VPS for less than Â£2 a month from many different providers; Low End Box provides links to all sorts of options. {by james-adam}

### [Why mobile web apps are slow](http://sealedabstract.com/rants/why-mobile-web-apps-are-slow/)

If mobile browsers are becoming more and more capable, why do so many companies insist on making dedicated apps for their products, rather than building a mobile web app?  There's probably a bit of walled garden building going on, not to mention some herd mentality (we've got to be on the App Store!), but this very comprehensive article points at a third reason - web apps on mobile phones are slow and will remain slow. {by tom-ward}

### [The #indieweb as a minimum viable social web ecosystem](http://werd.io/entry/51dca7e2bed7de945debf707/the-indieweb-as-a-minimum-viable-social-web-ecosystem)

This great post (hosted on the [idno](http://idno.co/) software) explains how we can build on the [indieweb](http://indiewebcamp.com/Main_Page) movement to find/demonstrate the business value in these "decentralized social models".

I find the work being done in this area really interesting and it really motivates me to want to build some of the indieweb features into [Roosmarks](https://github.com/chrisroos/roosmarks). {by chris-roos}

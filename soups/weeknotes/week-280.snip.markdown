Week 280
========

Another short week this week, what with the splendid bank holiday an' all.

James and I continued to work with Makie, spending three days on the project this week. We're continuing to make progress but the unfamiliarity of both the language and domain certainly makes it feel as though we're moving slightly slower than we're used to.

Apart from heading to the pub on Wednesday for our monthly drinks, I'm not sure there's too much else to report so I'll leave it there for this week.

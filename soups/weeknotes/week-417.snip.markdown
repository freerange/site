Week 417
========

* We continued to make progress on the [GDS][gds] contract. We've agreed a start date of 30 Jan. We've also agreed to opt out of the [agency business regulations][agency-business-regulations] as part of our agreement with [Digital Gurus][digital-gurus]. We haven't had to do this before and don't really understand it but our reading suggested that opting out was OK.

* We both spent some time working on [Mocha][mocha] on Wednesday; mostly responding to issues and PRs. I was hoping to get my [long running refactoring branch][mocha-pr-269] merged but ended up spending ages trying to understand the behaviour of passing a file name and line number to `class_eval`.

* We've agreed, and started, to help organise a [CoTech][co-tech] evening during the [Open 2017 platform cooperatives conference][open-2017].

* I spent some time learning about [Cobudgeting][cobudget] and more generally about [Enspiral][enspiral]. This led to a video conference with some [Outlandish][outlandish] and Enspiral folks on Thursday.

* [James][james-mead] spent a while spiking on moving our [GFR website][gfr-site] from [Vanilla][vanilla-rb] to a custom Rails app. We think/hope this'll make it slightly easier to maintain.

* We visited Ian Southwood at [Energized Work][energized-work] on Friday afternoon. James used to work with Ian and GFR have been aware of Energized Work for a while. It was interesting to learn that our organisations have quite a lot in common despite them being quite a bit larger than us.

* We started to collect material with the intention of writing a GFR's 2016 blog post. Be sure to look out for that in early 2018!

* We hosted [Show & Tell 28][show-and-tell-28] on Wednesday.

That's all for now. Until next time.

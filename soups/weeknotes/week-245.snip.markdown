Week 245
========

I'm afraid this weeks notes are a bit thin on the ground, because I'm on holiday tomorrow (Friday) and I'm running out of time to write something.

[Chris](/chris-roos) was back at work on Tuesday after his long weekend of surfing down in Cornwall, although he was a bit battered and bruised having been dumped by one wave too many.

Later in the week, it was really good to catch up with [James A](/james-adam) while he was visiting from the USA. We had some useful discussions about our plans in the cafe at the [Hoxton Hotel](http://www.hoxtonhotels.com/) -- it's almost as if it was a proper "business" meeting, except we weren't wearing suits.

Although things have been a bit quieter after the launch last week, work at [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com) continues apace as we gear up for the start of the first public courses. You can still [register](https://www.futurelearn.com/register) and enrol on courses like [Climate Change](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/climate-change-challenges-and-solutions), [The Discovery of the Higgs Boson](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/higgs) and [England in the Time of King Richard III](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/england-of-richard-third).


Although I've left it to last, the big news for this week is that [Tom](/tom-ward) is leaving [Go Free Range](/) for pastures new. We're sad that Tom is leaving us, but happy for Tom and we wish him all the best in his new role.

Anyway, that's it for now. Have a great weekend.

-- James

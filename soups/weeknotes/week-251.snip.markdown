Week 251
========

Afternoon, folks.

I trust you all had splendid weekends. I spent Saturday running and walking along part of [the Ridgeway](http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/ridgeway/) for day two of the [Druid Challenge](http://www.xnrg.co.uk/druid2013.htm). It was a great day and I'm now looking to see what else I can sign myself up for.

On the GFRHQ front, we've appointed Stirling Ackroyd to help us try to sublet our office. You can see the [advert on the Stirling Ackroyd site](http://www.stirlingackroyd.com/commercial-properties/offices-commercial-space-for-rent-in-london/worship/ec2a/SAC87LET) and, if you look closely enough, you'll even catch a glimpse of me modelling a very fashionable standing desk. Oh yeah.

On the GFR front, [James M](/james-mead) and I spent a good chunk of Wednesday going through all the things we need to do to remove [Tommo](https://tomafro.net/) from the company. It's taking a while but we think we have a pretty good grasp of the remaining tasks and just about have the end in sight.

On the [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/) front, aside from continuing with the development, we've been participating in some good discussions about both design in browser, and testing approaches within the project.

And that'll have to do for now. Have good weeks my friends.

-- Chris

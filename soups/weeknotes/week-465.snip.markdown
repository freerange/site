Week 465
========

Afternoon y'all,

We've had a productive week working on the [Asset Manager][asset-manager] project.

We've worked from [TOG][the-office-group] Old Street, TOG Whitechapel, TOG Bloomsbury and from home.

## Asset Manager

We had our regular catch-up with [GDS][gds] at the beginning of the week. It mostly consisted of us listing the various reasons that we hadn't made as much progress as we'd hoped. Fortunately, both [Daniel][daniel-roseman] and Stephen were very understanding.

I think we've made some really good progress this week. Which feels particularly good after the disappointment of not having much to show at our GDS catch-up. [Chris][chris-lowis] has deployed a change that means we're uploading all new Whitehall assets to Asset Manager and has removed a (very) small number of Whitehall assets from the NFS mount. [James][james-mead] has been removing lots of redundant code from Asset Manager as well as researching off-site backup solutions. And I think I've finally got to the bottom of the long-standing issue that meant we weren't always sending a `Content-Type` header with our assets.

## Show & Tell 39

We hosted our 39th [Show & Tell][show-and-tell-events] at [Forge & Co][forge-and-co] on Wednesday. It was quiet with just James, Ben G, Tom S and me in attendance. I enjoyed it and hope to write it up properly in the next week.

## CoTech

We're continuing to make progress on the promotional collaboration with a subset of CoTech members and I've been invoicing people for their share of the bar tab at Wortley Hall.

I think that's about all for now.

Until next time.

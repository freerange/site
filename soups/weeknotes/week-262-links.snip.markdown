### [Say Welcome to the First Open Source Bank Manager!](http://blog.cozycloud.cc/news/2013/12/12/welcome-to-the-first-web-open-source-bank-manager/)

[Cozycloud](https://www.cozycloud.cc/) have announced an app that allows you to interact with a number of banking websites through a simpler, standard interface. I've thought about making something similar in the past so I'm interested to see how this develops. {by chris-roos}

### [Healthy benefits for the long run](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3703-healthy-benefits-for-the-long-run)

> We ultimately want 37signals to have the potential of being the last job our people ever need. When you think about what itâ€™ll take to keep someone happy and fulfilled for 10, 20, 30 years into the future, you adopt a very different vantage point from our industry norm.

I love what 37 Signals are trying to do here and would love for us to be thinking along similar lines at GFR. Obviously, we're not doing quite so well what with [Tommo](/tom-ward) having disappeared to 37 Signals but I'd like to think we can keep trying. {by chris-roos}

Week 421
========

_Note that I'm writing these notes about 4 months late which is why they're in summary form._

* Worked at home, Aviation House and [TOG Bloomsbury][the-office-group].

* Hosted [GFR Show & Tell 29][show-and-tell-29] on Wednesday.

* Continued organising the [CoTech][co-tech] social during [Open 2017][open-2017].

* Arranged to meet Jack of [Fairmondo UK][fairmondo-uk] during Open 2017.

* James and I met [Ross Ferguson][ross-ferguson] for lunch on Wednesday. We worked with Ross during the early days of GDS but hadn't seen him for a long time. It was good to catch up, hear what he's been up to and to learn what he's doing back at GDS.

* James renewed the SSL certificate for the [Hookline][hookline] music app. This is still a manual process and slightly more complicated than we'd like.

* James upgraded our [Twilio][twilio] account so that we can use it for our office phone number.

Week 328 - Interesting links
============================

### [Why we need the IndieWeb](https://barryfrost.com/2015/04/here-s-a-video-of-the)

I really recommend this 35 minute video to anyone that wants an overview of the [IndieWeb][]. I think Barry does a great job: He discusses the motivations for wanting to own your content, an overview of the current state of the IndieWeb and closes by giving some tips about how to get started. {by chris-roos}

### [Deleting the Family Tree](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2015/04/myfamily_shuttered_ancestry_com_deleted_10_years_of_my_family_history.html)

Very much inline with the IndieWeb link above, this story describes the disappointing state of affairs when it comes to relying on big companies to look after your data. Having informed users that they'd be able to download their MyFamily.com archives when the service shut last year, Ancestry.com appear to have gone back on their word and not made users' data available. Sad times. {by chris-roos}

### [PageDiff Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-Us/firefox/addon/pagediff/)

This came in handy when we were trying to ensure we hadn't broken the rendered HTML in our current client project. You choose the first page, tell the extension to "Start DIFF", switch to the second page and then "Show DIFF". I'm not sure you'd want to use this to compare lots of pages but it was perfect to check the couple that we were interested in. {by chris-roos}

### [In My Footsteps](http://www.inmyfootsteps.org/)

I like the idea of this site. Residents in the East End of London are creating tours of their local area. You can follow the tours virtually through the website, or physically with the help of the mobile app. There aren't many tours at the moment, but hopefully this'll increase over time.

The geolocation aspect reminded me of an [idea I had a few years back][geolocated-audio]. I wanted people to be able to record audio snippets and tie them to a geographical location. Listeners could then have an app that played random snippets based on where they were at the time. I haven't looked recently but I can only imagine that someone has done this by now. {by chris-roos}

### [How to Paint a City | Lee Bofkin | TEDxClapham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoTNhzztj2s)

I really enjoyed this talk about [Global Street Art][] (Lee's a fellow [Shoreditch Works][] resident) and how they're trying to make it easier for artists to get the permission required to paint our streets.

It reminded me of this [Banksy quote][] that I think I read in Wall and Piece:

> the people who run our cities dont understand graffiti because they think nothing has the right to exist unless it makes a profit...
>
> the people who truly deface our neighborhoods are the companies that scrawl giant slogans across buildings and buses trying to make us feel inadequate unless we buy their stuff....
>
> any advertisement in public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours, it belongs to you ,, its yours to take, rearrange and re use.Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head..

I'm happy that Global Street Art and others are trying, and succeeding, to convince the people in power that art has as much of a place on the streets as advertising. {by chris-roos}

Week 420
========

## Chris Lowis joins GFR!

Exciting news! We're finally able to share that [Chris Lowis is joining us after 3Â½ years at FutureLearn][chris-lowis-tweet]. We look forward to welcoming him towards the end of February.

## GDS

James and I started our new contract at [GDS][gds] this week. We've been asked to investigate how manuals are published on GOV.UK with a view to removing complexity and possible duplication.

We spent the majority of the week working on this project. Getting up to speed with the software, speaking to a number of different people to gather information, and even starting to make small improvements to some of the apps.

## CoTech

We continued to help organise the [CoTech social][cotech-social] during [Open:2017][open-2017]. Brian at Outlandish emailed the group to explain [how we're going to try to use Cobudget to fund the bar tab][brian-cobudget-email].

We used Loomio to get agreement about content for the CoTech website, due to be launched at Open:2017.

## Office phone number

[James][james-mead] started to experiment with using [Twilio][twilio] to get a company phone number.

Until next time.

-- Chris

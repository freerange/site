Week 410
========

Week 410 was pretty quiet. James spent the week skiing in Austria and I spent quite a bit of time getting ready to move on to the houseboat.

## Hookline

I think the only thing I did of any real interest was to renew the [Let's Encrypt][lets-encrypt] SSL certificate we're using on the [Hookline][hookline] music app.

The app's hosted on Heroku which means that this renewal process isn't entirely trivial. In fact, it felt as though I had to do almost as much to renew as I did to generate the certificate in the first place. I'm hoping that someone else is going to do the hard work to make this much easier next time round :-)

Until next time.

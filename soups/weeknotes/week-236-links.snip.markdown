### [What is Programmer Anarchy and does it have a future?](http://martinjeeblog.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/what-is-programmer-anarchy-and-does-it-have-a-future/)

This is an outsider's impressions of how Fred George's post-agile [Programmer Anarchy](https://vimeo.com/43690647) works at [Forward](http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/). I don't agree with the author's conclusion that "any kind of team will always need a division of labour, a leadership structure to organize and motivate the team", but it was an interesting read none-the-less. {by james-mead}


### [How I Earned A Lot More on Projects by Changing My Pricing Strategy](http://sixrevisions.com/business/earn-more-on-projects/)

Although I've never been convinced that fixing a price for a project up-front is a good idea for either party, I think there are some interesting ideas in this article e.g. "value-based pricing" and "positioning the price as an investment, not an expense". {by james-mead}

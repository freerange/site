Week 285 - Interesting links
============================

### [Docker on your Server](http://interblah.net/docker-on-your-server)

[James Adam][] has been playing with [Docker][] in the context of running a few different apps on his personal VPS. If there's enough interest, he's going to write an e-book on the subject. If this is something you're interested in, I'd encourage you to [sign up][]. {by james-mead}


### [QuickMVP](https://quickmvp.com/)

I noticed that James A is using this to test demand for his "Docker on your Server" e-book. It looks as if it offers a bit more than the average "landing page" service. Maybe worth a bit more of a look. {by james-mead}


### [Split ticker finder](http://split.traintimes.org.uk/)

I'm not sure how long this website by the prolific [Matthew Somerville][] has been live, but it's great. He explains:

> The railway's national fares database is a very complicated affair, built up over many years and dealing with an extraordinary array of restrictions and conditions. This means that it is easily possible for two or more tickets to act identically to one through ticket, but be substantially cheaper.

If you're a train nerd and you want to get into the nitty gritty, then this [RailUK Fares & Ticketing Guide post][] on split ticketing is essential reading, but the nub of the matter is that it may be cheaper to buy separate tickets for two parts of your journey. {by james-mead}

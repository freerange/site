Week 284 - Interesting links
============================

### [Broccoli: First Beta Release](http://www.solitr.com/blog/2014/02/broccoli-first-release/)

This is an interesting new alternative to the Rails asset pipeline which runs on [node.js][]. A nice example of one of its plugins is the [es6-concatenator][broccoli-es6-concatenator] which is a "shim" for [ECMAScript 6 imports][ecmascript-6-import-declaration]. Via [Tom Stuart][]. {by james-mead}


### [The CRAPL: An academic-strength open source license](http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/)

I applaud anything that encourages academics to release the source code connected to their research - it's crazy that this is still the exception and not the rule. However, I can't help wondering that if the majority of software is "stapled together on a tight deadline; and it's not pretty code", then perhaps the majority of academic software is full of bugs. {by james-mead}


### [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/)

This allows people to offer a bounty for work on specific open-source features and bugs. I like the fact that you can post a bounty by just referencing a GitHub issue URL. {by james-mead}


### [I fought the law and the users won: delivering online voter registration](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/06/20/i-fought-the-law-and-the-users-won-delivering-online-voter-registration/)

This is a great (and unfortunately rare) example of inter-disciplinary collaboration and it's particularly brilliant that they got some laws *changed* while developing the service. {by james-mead}

### [Chrome for Android's Find in Page Icon](http://googlesystem.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/chrome-for-androids-special-find-in-page.html)

I never knew about this "Find in page" functionality on Chrome for Android. In fact, even after reading this post I still managed to fail to use it the first couple of times, until I read/realised that I needed to click on the icon instead of the text. {by chris-roos}


### [Set the Desktop Picture to NASA Image of the Day](http://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/examples/ex08/03.html)

I've never used the Mac Automator before so I was pleased to find this post that walked me through creating a workflow to download an image and automatically set it as my background. I've amended the workflow to point to an [ATOM feed of latest images of the Thames, and have that running every 15 minutes with cron](http://chrisroos.co.uk/blog/2013-09-09-automatically-updating-my-desktop-background-from-my-thames-time-lapse-pictures). The result is that I get to see what my camera can see out of my bedroom window. Which is schweeeeet. {by chris-roos}

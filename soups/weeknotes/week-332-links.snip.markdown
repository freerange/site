Week 332 - Interesting links
============================

### [Mondo](http://getmondo.co.uk/)

Last year when we were working on our [Credit Union project](/credit-union), we met up with Tom Blomfield to chat about what he was doing at Bank Possible (which is now called [Starling](https://starlingbank.co.uk/)). It turns out that he's now [left Starling and has started his own mobile-first bank](http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/24/mondo/), Mondo.

I also recently came across [Monese](http://www.monese.com/) which seems to be offering something similar. It certainly seems as if there's loads of activity in this sector. I can't wait for some better offerings to appear - they're long overdue. {by james-mead}


### [Microservice Premium](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePremium.html)

In this article Martin Fowler says:

> My primary guideline would be **don't even consider microservices unless you have a system that's too complex to manage as a monolith**. The majority of software systems should be built as a single monolithic application. Do pay attention to good modularity within that monolith, but don't try to separate it into separate services.

Apparently microservices are the new hotness. So-called "monolithic" applications are not. It's unfortunate that the word "monolithic" is used so pejoratively. The development and operational costs of building an application as a set of microservices are often massively under-estimated. {by james-mead}


### [Inbox SDK](https://www.inboxsdk.com/)

This is supposedly a high-level JavaScript library with which you can build browser extensions to interact with your Gmail account. It seems to have been extracted from [Streak CRM](https://www.streak.com/) and as far as I can see [it's free](https://www.inboxsdk.com/terms) to use, although not open-source. Chris & I often talk about automating the handling of company-related emails and I thought this might be worth a try. {by james-mead}


### [Dynamic Site as fast as a Static Generated One with Raptor](http://www.akitaonrails.com/2015/05/20/dynamic-site-as-fast-as-a-static-generated-one-with-raptor)

A while ago Chris talked about moving his blog from [Webby](http://webby.rubyforge.org/) to a standard Rails app. He thought that by taking full advantage of HTTP caching he'd be able to achieve similar performance to that of a static website. This article reminded me of that conversation. {by james-mead}


### [githop](https://github.com/neonichu/githop)

This is like [Timehop](http://timehop.com/), but for GitHub. It reminded me of an idea Chris had recently - showing you your own commit messages some time after you made them to see whether you can still understand what you meant. {by james-mead}

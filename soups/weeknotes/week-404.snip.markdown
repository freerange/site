Week 404
========

James continued to hold the fort while I spent quite a bit of the week working on the houseboat.

## Mocha

James released version 1.2 of Mocha on Monday. Unfortunately, we soon learnt that this release could cause the Ruby interpreter to hang in specific circumstances. Eeek! James investigated the problem and submitted a bug report to Ruby. It's a "showstopper" bug! James spent the best part of Tuesday and Wednesday investigating the bug.

Bit of a revelation during show and tell. Allowed us to fix the problem and release 1.2.1 on Saturday.

### Digital Co-ops Retreat

James booked train tickets to the event in Sheffield. Another task that could be handled by an admin assistant.

## Hookline

James enabled multipart uploads to fix a problem with uploading a zip file of the entire music catalog to S3. This was much easier than expected.

Add delayed job web interface - so that we can see what's going on with jobs.

Various smaller interface tweaks to make the site more consistent.

Enabled Papertrail loggin add-on in Heroku. Apparently very intuitive and easy to use.

Final import of music library on Friday. Asked Hookline to start using the app in anger. This is great.

## GFR

I spent some time trying to understand Vanilla and our site in general. I understand a lot more about the content we have. The files are more consistent and I think we'll be in a better position to switch to some static site generation tool.

Created Heroku organisation. Had to upgrade errbit to hobby plan but that doesn't feel like a bad thing.

Updating our address with various organisations since moving to UK Postbox address.

## Show and Tell

Hosted on Wednesday evening. You can read all about it at /show-and-tell-25.

It took me a number of hours to write up the show and tell event. It's like a mini conference. I end up doing some research about the topics that were discussed but this all takes time. The other thing that takes time is that I have to then turn these things into English sentences!

James created a new Slack room and deployed the Slackin app to Heroku to allow people to join.

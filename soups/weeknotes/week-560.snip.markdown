Week 560
========

Happy Friday! I'm spending the day at our office today which makes a really nice change (I've been based out of FutureLearn's office in Camden with James for the last few months).

In happy news Ben is feeling better and back in the office. In sad news, it's Gregory's last day with us today. We're also saying goodbye to [Tom W][tom-ward] who's been filling in for Ben for a couple of weeks. Thanks to both of you for all your hard work!

This week was the last week of the quarter for our team at FutureLearn. We had a review and final retro and I think we're all happy that we managed to deliver something concrete by the end of the quarter. We also made the decision that we'd leave FutureLearn at the end of the next sprint because the project with The Audience Agency is ramping up and it gives us the opportunity to all work together on the same thing, which has been something we've missed over the last 6 months. It has been really enjoyable working at FutureLearn again, they're a very kind, friendly and talented bunch of people working on an interesting problem and we hope to be able to work with them again in the future.

[Tom][tom-ward] and [Chris][chris-roos] continued work on The Audience Agency project, working out a way to incorporate data from surveys into the first report.

We spent today reviewing and retrospecting with The Audience Agency team, catching up on a few tasks, sending some mission patches in the post and helping Gregory add some GFR-related things to his [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-bent-68330a107/).

Have a great weekend folks!

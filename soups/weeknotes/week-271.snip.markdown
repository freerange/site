Week 271
========

These are possibly the latest week notes ever. Sorry. My excuse is that I've been laid low by a horrible vomiting bug.

This was the week we began work back at [FutureLearn][], helping them review their current video solution. It was nice to catch up with [Joel][Joel Chippindale], [Matt][Matt Walton] and the rest of the team in a visit to the FutureLearn office at the [British Library][] on Monday, but it's also been good to be able to do most of the work from our office.

At the end of our visit, we were invited to stay for a talk by [Linda Sandvik][] about [Code Club][] and teaching programming. It was impressive to hear how Code Club started (from a pub conversation and a single tweet) and about how quickly it's grown.

On Wednesday we gathered for some drinks with a few friends of [GFR][] in the tiny [Jerusalem Tavern][] where we were lucky to be able to secure a table quite early in the evening. I seem to remember some pretty involved techie conversations including one about concurrency, the [actor model][], and even [Haskell][], but much of the evening is lost in a haze of IPA.

Anyway, that's about all for now.

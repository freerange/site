### [Measures/Countermeasures](http://scraplab.net/measures-countermeasures/)

An extremely readable overview by [Tom Taylor](http://scraplab.net) to one new technique being developed by advertisers to track behavioural patterns: beacons in recycling bins are tracking phones using their MAC addresses. Tom also hints at some ways that you can defeat the tracking too. {by james-adam}


### [Showterm](http://showterm.io/)

Really simple recording of terminal output, that can be replayed on the web, or embedded in presentations or on your own site. Here's one I prepared earlier, using the brilliant [Qlobe](http://mamememo.blogspot.com/2010/09/qlobe.html) quine:

### [Enterprise Wiki](http://public.enterprisewiki.co/)

This simple wiki lets you edit its contents in Markdown by just hitting `ESC` and typing. It looks like it's using [Operational Transformations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation) behind the scenes to make saving the contents relatively seamless. {by james-adam}


### [5 Steps to $5,000 in Monthly Recurring Revenue](http://blog.statuspage.io/5-steps-to-5000-in-monthly-recurring-revenue)

I thought this was a good writeup of how [StatusPage](http://www.statuspage.io/) identified a problem worth solving and built a product to solve it. I was particularly interested to read how they went about finding new users. {by james-mead}


### [Noon](https://getnoon.com/)

A neat little wireless flash for your iPhone. {by james-mead}


### [Why I publish my blog posts before they are ready](http://www.marianamota.com/why-i-post-my-blog-posts-before-they-are-ready/)

I'd like to blog more. I tend to struggle at two points in the writing cycle - getting started and pushing the publish button. Mariana's trick might help me solve the latter - just publish before it's ready and use the fact that it's live to drive you to finish it. {by james-mead}


### [Persona makes signing in easy for Gmail users](http://identity.mozilla.com/post/57712756801/persona-makes-signing-in-easy-for-gmail-users)

Mozilla's Persona seems like a really promising authentication system and now they've built an [Identity Bridge](http://identity.mozilla.com/post/56526022621/what-is-an-identity-bridge) for Gmail, so now you can login using your existing Gmail credentials. {by james-mead}

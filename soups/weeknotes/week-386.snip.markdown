Week 386
========

_Note that we're writing these notes nearly 6 months late which is why they're in summary form._

## GFR

* We hosted our [21st Show & Tell][show-and-tell-21] on Wednesday.

* James joined Ben G and a few others at the Barbican on Thursday and Friday for a bit of a hack session. James managed to get his [sub-hunt game][sub-hunt] (written when he was a teenager) working on a JavaScript ZX Spectrum emulator.

* I created a new Trello account for GFR specific boards. I was previously using a single account but was feeling somewhat overwhelmed by having all notifications in my personal email account.

* We started using labels in Trello to indicate whether we're waiting on input from either of us or from a third party. This helps us see at a glance whether our input is required to make progress with a card.

* We split a couple of the larger monthly Harmonia tasks: "Update FreeAgent and Pay Bills" and "Pay our Wages".

* We started experimenting with using Harmonia to assign responsibilities for emails that need to be handled.

* Ongoing discussions with our new accountant to help him prepare our annual accounts.

Week 296
========

G'day, folks. I hope you're all well, and that those of you in London are enjoying this beautiful September weather.

* We made some progress on the Video project, although maybe not as much as we would've liked. Both [James][] and I ended up spending longer than expected on two unrelated tasks: James on introducing [Login with Amazon][] and me configuring SSL for the app.

* [Murray][] popped in for lunch on Monday. We had a great discussion about structuring web apps (specifically when you might choose to break a growing app apart) and STI.

* James and I met someone involved with 3D printing about some potential work. It was a relatively short meeting which meant that we didn't really get to go into too much detail about how we work. James subsequently did a great job of documenting the important aspects and sending them over in an email. It reminded us that this is another thing we'd like to add to our business wiki/site.

* We had hoped to meet Tom Blomfield following his "[Help us build a bank for the internet][]" email to the Lrug list. Unforuntately, circumstances conspired against us and it didn't happen. We've rescheduled for this week and we're pretty excited to hear what they're doing.

* After a few failed attempts, James and I managed to meet [Tom Hall][] and [Mike Jones][] for lunch on Wednesday. We both worked with Mike way back at [Reevoo][] and with Tom more recently at [FutureLearn][]. It was great to catch up and I am now able to recommend the pizzas at [Del Mercato][].

* [Chris Lowis][] was in on Thursday. We managed to fit in some lunchtime [lawn bowling action at Finsbury Square][Finsbury Square bowls] _and_ an afterwork pint. A successful day all round! I only became aware of the bowling green recently but can definitely recommend it as a way to spend an hour.

* James and I left the office earlier than usual on Friday. James travelled down to the Isle of Wight to help with [Bart's Bash at Yarmouth Sailing Club][], and I travelled to a little village near Stratford-upon-Avon for a wedding.

Until next time.

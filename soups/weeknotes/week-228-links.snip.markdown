### [Collaborative editing with different editors](https://floobits.com/)

I know {l james-mead,James M} has already been looking into collaborative editor environments (see {l week-227-links,CoVIM from last week}), but wouldn't it be better if you could each use your own preferred editor? Floobits would seem to promise exactly that. They've written plugins for VIM and Sublime Text already, which could be enough for us to try it out in earnest soon.

Unfortunately, I couldn't actually get it to work. {by james-adam}


### [Build your own Heroku with Cloud Foundry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0EprkBamvQ&feature=youtu.be)

The inimitable [Dr Nic](http://drnicwilliams.com/) gave a talk last month on building a Heroku-like system with Cloud Foundry.  I'm always looking for ways to make the process of getting an app up and running faster, and have watched enough of this to see it looks really promising.  I hope to try it this week - I'll let you know how I get on. {by tom-ward}

### [Reach For The Dead](https://soundcloud.com/warp-records/reach-for-the-dead)

Boards of Canada, my favourite Scottish musicians (sorry Runrig) have a new album out early next month.  Last week warp posted this track onto Soundcloud.  You've probably already heard it, but if not put it on repeat while you wait with the rest of us for the full album. {by tom-ward}

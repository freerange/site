### [SASS Rails Source Maps](https://github.com/vhyza/sass-rails-source-maps)

I spent some time last week investigating the current state of SASS debugging in the browser. It turns out that Chrome 30 removes support of the SASS output generated by `debug_info`, but includes support for [CSS source maps](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/css-preprocessors). Using this 'sass-rails-source-maps' gem, in combination with a pre-release of SASS 3.3, allows you to generate these source maps and bring SASS debugging goodness back to Chrome 30. {by chris-roos}

### [SASS Rails Source Maps](https://github.com/vhyza/sass-rails-source-maps)

I recently spent some time investigating the current state of [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) debugging in the browser. It turns out that Chrome 30 removes support of the SASS output generated by `debug_info`, but includes support for [CSS source maps](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/css-preprocessors). Using this 'sass-rails-source-maps' gem, in combination with a pre-release of SASS 3.3, allows you to generate these source maps and bring SASS debugging goodness back to Chrome 30. {by chris-roos}


### [ActiveInbox](http://www.activeinboxhq.com/index.php)

I had a little play with this last week. My current loosely-adhered-to system is to either deal with an email immediately or add it to Google Tasks with an action. This works well enough on the desktop but the lack of Google Tasks integration in the Gmail Android app leaves me with a different workflow on my mobile. While I like the look of ActiveInbox, it doesn't seem to avoid this problem and so I'm not sure that I'll make the switch. {by chris-roos}

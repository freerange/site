Week 247
========

So here are my last ever weeknotes, and as is traditional when I write them, they're late.  I'm sure that's one of many bad habits my former GFR colleagues will be glad to see the back of.

Normally I'm late for a number of reasons, one of which is I don't really know what to include.  I struggle to find things that describe the week and make it seem interesting, vibrant, and accessible.  This week though I have the opposite problem.  Friday was my last day at GFR after over 3.5 years, and I have so much I'd like to say I don't know where to begin.

I'll start by saying what a pleasure it has been working with such intelligent and capable colleagues.  I'm lucky to have worked with each and every one of them, and have learnt so much from them all.

Go Free Range hasn't turned out how any of us expected it would, yet while the destination may have changed, the journey has always been a pleasure.  I'm proud of the things we've built ourselves, such as [harmonia](https://harmonia.io), [printer](http://gofreerange.com/printer), [recap](https://github.com/freerange/recap), and many many more.  I'm proud of the things we've acheived for our clients - including launching hashblue.com with O2, [gov.uk/government](https://www.gov.uk/government) with the UK government, and most recently working on [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com).  And I'm proud of the times we've been able to lead others down a more agile path; I hope our influence in projects is felt long after we've left (in a good way!).

There's much more I could say, but not without boring your socks off, so until we meet again, [here's the von Trapp family](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNs3nK31DKc).

Week 503
========

Hello! All four of us were working and co-located this week. It feels like this is the first time it has happened for a while with all of us taking leave at different times over the summer. We made the most of it by taking a day away from our current client project to reflect and plan during our quarterly "away day".

## The Trainline

We continued working for our client [The Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/). We are continuing to work with them to improve monitoring of third-party systems and consolidate the `trainline.eu` and `trainline.com` code bases.

## Away Day

On Tuesday we spent a few hours at the [West Reservoir Centre](https://hackney.gov.uk/west-reservoir) in Hackney. This sailing and open-water swimming centre also has a great conference room with views over the reservoir and a pleasant cafe. We divided the time into short sessions where we discussed upcoming client work opportunities, how to make the most of our non-client time and whether we want to get some help with our routine administrative tasks. I think we made some good decisions in all of these areas but also, more importantly, took some time to reach a shared understanding of what we've done and where we want to go. In the afternoon we had a table booked at the board game cafe above the [EXP Cantina at Swan Wharf](https://goo.gl/maps/mcC7uT1pmeK2). It's a huge open space with a great selection of board games. The staff their helped us choose some suitable games to play. I particularly enjoyed our game of the co-operative classic [Pandemic](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic) - so much so that I bought a copy to play at home.

We're all together again this Friday in our office in Whitechapel - as well as tying up some admin loose-ends we should be able to make a bit of progress on our side-project.

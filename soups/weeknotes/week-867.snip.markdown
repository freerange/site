Week 867
========

Week beginning Monday, 25th August 2025.

[Chris L] has been on leave again this week continuing his well-deserved break. Monday was a bank holiday.

The [Raspberry Pi Foundation] have extended our contract, so we will be continuing to work on the [Experience CS] project, albeit with a reduced team size. The focus of the work is likely to shift to helping the [Code Editor for Education] (CEfE) team with on-boarding and classroom-management functionality as the start of the school year is nearly upon us.

[Seb] has done some great work this week making it easier for a teacher to add [Scratch] projects to a class in CEfE from the curriculum pages.

In the meantime, [Chris R] and I have been working on adding a bunch of reporting using [BigQuery] & [Looker Studio] and then latterly spiking on providing a way to more easily add students to a class in CEfE. Fraser continued to spike on improving the CEfE functionality for adding students to a school.

Having sorted out [my claim] for the use of my home as an office, [our accountants] finalised our annual accounts and submitted them to Companies House and HMRC.

And that's about the size of it for this week.

Until next time.

Week 295 - Interesting links
============================

### [Seeing Is Believing](https://github.com/JoshCheek/seeing_is_believing)

This Ruby gem allows you to display the results of every line of code within various text editors. Neat. Via [Tom S](http://codon.com). {by james-mead}


### [A Little Printer Mystery](http://exciting.io/2014/09/09/a-little-printer-mystery/)

I was sad to hear about the [demise of BERG](http://blog.bergcloud.com/2014/09/09/week-483/) and the [uncertain future of Little Printer](http://littleprinterblog.tumblr.com/post/97047976103/the-future-of-little-printer) earlier this week, but I was somewhat cheered by [James A](http://interblah.net/)'s tale of mysterious conversations appearing in the output of Little Printers around the world.


### [Git Pretty](http://justinhileman.info/article/git-pretty/)

This is a handy flowchart for working out what to do if you get yourself into a mess with git. Not something that _ever_ happens to me! {by james-mead}


### [All our Coderwall are belong to you](http://hackernoons.com/all-our-coderwall-are-belong-to-you)

In what looks like a significant [pivot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup#Pivot), the people who built [Coderwall](https://coderwall.com/) have [open-sourced the codebase](https://github.com/assemblymade/coderwall) and plan to [share the revenue with the community](https://assemblymade.com/help/basics) who they hope will continue to develop it.

It looks like they're using Coderwall as an exemplar for their new _crowd-founding_ website, [Assembly](https://assembly.com/). I've not really used Coderwall myself, but I _am_ interested in this open-source revenue-sharing model.

Also this quote is a great advertisement for how open-sourcing your code tends to make you want to improve its quality:

> Sharing a still-running product's source code is mildly unsettling. Unlike our other open source code which we write for public consumption, this wasn't originally intended to be so. It has its share of technical debt [...]

We have experience of this having helped develop [Inside Government](/inside-government) in [the open](https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall). {by james-mead}


### [Network Rail opens up about the causes of delays](http://conversation.which.co.uk/transport-travel/network-rail-train-delays/)

I applaud this attempt by Network Rail to better explain the reasons for delayed trains. More transparency, please! {by james-mead}


### [COBOL on COGS](http://www.coboloncogs.org/INDEX.HTM)

The next big thing? {by james-mead}

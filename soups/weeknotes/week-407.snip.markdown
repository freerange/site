* Chris wrote up some notes on our meeting with Alex S & Paul B at GDS last week

* James & Chris did some investigation into running the Mocha build on Ruby v1.8.6, but failed. So then merged a PR requiring >= v1.8.7 in gemspec - https://github.com/freerange/mocha/pull/208
* Arranged a meeting with Hookline about plans for the Music Library project

* Open source: James checked build passed with HEAD version of JRuby - https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/274#issuecomment-257445355
* Open source: James released new versions of the introspection ( https://rubygems.org/gems/introspection/versions/0.0.4) & instantiator (https://rubygems.org/gems/instantiator/versions/0.0.7) gems prompted by a comment by Charles Nutter - https://github.com/freerange/mocha/issues/274#issuecomment-256157095
* Book-keeping: Chris wrote up some notes on how we handle VAT on USD transactions and on what is allowable as an expense for coffee/lunch based on input from Proactive Paul
* Business development: James emailed Amy to express our interest in the CMA Open Banking project
* Chris played around a bit more with IFTTT to create cards in Trello based on events in Google Calendar. However, we were a bit alarmed to discover that if the card creation failed, we were not notified even though an error showed up in the IFTTT log. We're planning to investigate alternatives to IFTTT in the future.
* Music Library: James added a filter to the Papertrail logging to reduce the rate of log messages so that we mostly stay within the free plan - http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/how-it-works/log-filtering/

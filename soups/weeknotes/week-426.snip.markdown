Week 426
========

Afternoon, folks. I hope you've all had a splendid week and that you've enjoyed the beautiful weather we've had if you're in London.

We spent three days working at [TOG][the-office-group] and two at home. [Chris][chris-lowis] spent Monday enjoying the sunshine in Oxford.

We continued to work on [GDS][gds] and GFR with a heavy bias toward working on GDS.

## GDS

We've make good progress in our quest to refactor and simplify the [manuals-publisher][manuals-publisher] app for GDS. We've [merged about 20 pull requests][manuals-publisher-week-426-prs] containing [1,412 additions and 3,072 deletions][manuals-publisher-week-426-comparison]. Notable changes include the removal of some indirection by inlining service registries and the move toward consistent naming of sections.

## GFR

We were joined for lunch on Tuesday by [Jusna][jusna]. Jusna's recently left FutureLearn (where we all worked together) so it was interesting to hear about her plans for the future.

We had a good conversation about some potential client work. It's a little different from the sort of engagement we've had historically so it was good to discuss it and come up with an approach we're all comfortable with.

Chris and I spent Friday morning evaluating the [Fairmondo][fairmondo] and [Sharetribe][sharetribe] codebases to determine their suitability for use for [Fairmondo UK][fairmondo-uk].

[Amy][amy-wagner] joined us for lunch on Friday so that we could bring Chris up to speed on our involvement with [Hookline][hookline] and so that we could all learn about Hookline's plans.

Until next time.

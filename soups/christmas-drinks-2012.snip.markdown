Christmas Drinks 2012!

### Is there anything that isn't better once it's been mulled?[^1]


I don't know about you, but I've been dreaming about that mulled wine <%= l('chris-roos', 'Chris') %> made <%= l('officewarming', 'last year') %>. In fact, it was so good that we're forcing him back into his kitchen to do it all again!

We'd love it if you'd join us [from 6pm on Wednesday 19th of December][lanyrd] for another little shindig in our office at [87 Worship Street, London EC2A 2BE][map].

If you [let us know you're coming][lanyrd], we'll be sure to get the fridge appropriately stocked. You could even tweet [@freerange][twitter] if you have any boozey requests (no guarantees though, right?).

Got any questions? [Send us an email](mailto:everyone@gofreerange.com?subject=Christmas 2012 Mullfest). Hopefully see you there!

[^1]: Bring whatever you like and we will mull it for you. Probably. (Probably not).

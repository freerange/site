Week 281 - Interesting links
============================

### [I Have No Idea What I'm Doing](http://codon.com/i-have-no-idea-what-im-doing)

The video and transcript of [Tom Stuart](https://twitter.com/tomstuart)'s thought-provoking talk at this year's Scottish Ruby Conference. I'm not a big fan of watching conference talks on video, so I really appreciate Tom taking the time to produce such a readable transcript. {by james-mead}


### [Using Git to refactor vCloud Tools into separate gems](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/06/04/using-git-to-refactor-vcloud-tools-into-separate-gems/)

I've previously written about how we put a lot of value on [curating git history](http://gofreerange.com/week-249-links#deliberate-githttprakeroutescomblogdeliberate-git) in order to explain our intentions to our future selves. In this write-up [Anna Shipman](https://twitter.com/annashipman) explains how she took this idea to a (good) extreme when she split a Ruby gem into multiple gems. She split the existing repository into a bunch of new repositories, but went to great lengths to retain the relevant git history from the old repository in each of the new repositories. {by james-mead}


### [Empathy](http://techbelly.ghost.io/empathy/)

It's great to see our friend, [Ben Griffiths](https://twitter.com/beng), blogging again. This article reminds us to be more empathetic and compassionate when working on an "over-complicated mess that could be oh, so simpler". Also it's useful to try to put yourself in the shoes of developers who will come to the code after you. {by james-mead}


### [andyw8/do_by - Automatically expiring TODO notes in Ruby](https://github.com/andyw8/do_by)

> This is a proof-of-concept of automatically-expiring TODO notes.

The idea of being reminded when TODO items go stale is something that I've thought about for a while. I'm not too keen on having the TODOs live in the code, but the principles here could easily be applied to an external TODO file. {by chris-roos}


### [uncss: Find Unused CSS](http://davidwalsh.name/uncss)

This looks like a nifty little utility to detect unused CSS.

There was also a handy little tip in the comments about using Chrome's web developer tools to find unused CSS in a single page:

> Open the Web Dev tools, Click on the Audits tab, click Run, and then look through the “Remove unused CSS rules” list.

I haven't come across that Chrome functionality before so that was a useful find.

Other commenters mention the [Dust-Me Selectors](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dust-me-selectors/) add-on for Firefox that claims to do something similar. {by chris-roos}


### [Harmonia paid plans are here! Get a discounted plan while they last!](http://harmonia.io/blog/harmonia-paid-plans-are-here/)

[James Adam](https://twitter.com/lazyatom) has announced the new paid plans for [Harmonia](https://harmonia.io/). We've paid up. Have you? {by chris-roos}

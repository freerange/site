Week 424 - Interesting links
============================

### [Leading Wisely Podcast with Ricardo Semler](http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/leading-wisely)

I've long been a fan of Semler's book [Maverick!: The Success Story Behind the World's Most Unusual Workplace](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Maverick-Success-Behind-Unusual-Workplace/dp/0712678867) which, despite the very cheesy cover, is a fascinating account of how he transformed Brazilian company Semco into a democratically run, decentralised organisation. I'd not kept up with what Semler has done since writing his book, but recently discovered this podcast where he interviews people who run businesses in interesting ways. The interviews are a bit abstract at times but there's also a lot of interesting stories and concrete advice too. [Episode 1](http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/leading-wisely/e/48947093) and 2 feature Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson from [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/). {by chris-lowis}

### [Cooperative Technologists official launch](https://www.coops.tech/)

The Cooperative Technologists (CoTech) are a network of worker-run cooperatives in the technology and digital sector. Go Free Range are a proud founding member and we [talked about attending the first CoTech retreat](http://gofreerange.com/week-409) back in Week 409. Since then the network has become more official with a set of services that are used to collaborate and communicate internally and a shiny new website which tells the public more about how we work and how you can work with us. {by chris-lowis}

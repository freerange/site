Week 491 - Interesting links
============================

### [Goodnight Disruption: a Tech Week party by CoTech](https://londontechweek.com/event/goodnight-disruption-a-tech-week-party-by-cotech-innovation)

We're proud to be financially supporting this party as an antidote to the more corporate [London Tech Week][] events with the idea of promoting [CoTech][], [the co-operatives][cotech-members] within it, and the [Space4][] co-working space.

> Meet, hear from and party with the people creating a new kind of tech industry, through tech companies owned and controlled by the people who do the work.

A contingent from [Go Free Range][] will be attending, so if you've got a project you'd like to talk to us about, please come along! <%= by('james-mead') %>

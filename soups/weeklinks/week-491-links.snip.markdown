### [Goodnight Disruption: a Tech Week party by CoTech](https://londontechweek.com/event/goodnight-disruption-a-tech-week-party-by-cotech-innovation)

We're proud to be financially supporting this party as an antidote to the more corporate [London Tech Week][] events with the idea of promoting [CoTech][], [the co-operatives][cotech-members] within it, and the [Space4][] co-working space.

> Meet, hear from and party with the people creating a new kind of tech industry, through tech companies owned and controlled by the people who do the work.

A contingent from [Go Free Range][] will be attending, so if you've got a project you'd like to talk to us about, please come along! <%= by('james-mead') %>

### [Mithering about the unmodellable](http://smethur.st/posts/176135867)

This is a fascinating post about the challenges of modelling the internal workings of the UK parliament.

> There's something slightly sad about defining these things in quite so deterministic a way, Parliament has functioned perfectly well without pinning these definitions down. It's a fairly minor example, but still we worry a little that we're taking a system that's open and adaptive and evolutionary, and trying to make it more amenable to computers. Which aren't any of those things.

This is an interesting issue which I hadn't really considered before. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [The Slow Death of Internet Explorer and the Future of Progressive Enhancement](https://alistapart.com/article/the-slow-death-of-internet-explorer-and-future-of-progressive-enhancement)

> All the way back in 2001, A List Apart stopped delivering a visual design to Netscape 4. Readership among users of that browser went up.

Note to self: remember that serving un-styled HTML to older browsers can give a "good enough" user experience. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [TOSBack | The Terms-Of-Service Tracker](https://tosback.org/)

> Terms of Service; Didn't Read‚Äù (short: ToS;DR) is a young project started in June 2012 to help fix the "biggest lie on the web": almost no one really reads the terms of service we agree to all the time.

I particularly like the way they track changes using git/GitHub! <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Let's Robot - User Created Robotic Telepresence Network](https://letsrobot.tv/)

This is a crazy, but fun, project that allows you to make your robot available on the internet for random punters to control using their browser! <%= by('james-mead') %>

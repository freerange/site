### [How do you build the right thing?](http://info.thoughtworks.com/How-do-you-build-the-right-thing-part1.html)

This is a collection of essays from ThoughtWorks designers who are finding ways to successfully blend together agile development practices with user-centred design [note: you have to give them your email address to download it] <%= by('james-mead') %>

### [London cycling campaign](http://lcc.org.uk/)

Both Chris and I have witnessed cyclists being hit by other vehicles this past week.  While the accident I saw just resulted in bumps and bruises, Chris had the misfortune to be nearby when [a cyclist was killed](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/family-pay-tribute-to-kind-compassionate-loving-alan-neve-51-who-was-killed-when-hit-by-tipper-truck-in-holborn-8713203.html).  The London cycling campaign are working towards making the streets safer for London's ever growing number of cyclists.  I believe they deserve our support. <%= by('tom-ward') %>

### [What is Programmer Anarchy and does it have a future?](http://martinjeeblog.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/what-is-programmer-anarchy-and-does-it-have-a-future/)

This is an outsider's impressions of how Fred George's post-agile [Programmer Anarchy](https://vimeo.com/43690647) works at [Forward](http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/). I don't agree with the author's conclusion that "any kind of team will always need a division of labour, a leadership structure to organize and motivate the team", but it was an interesting read none-the-less. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [How I Earned A Lot More on Projects by Changing My Pricing Strategy](http://sixrevisions.com/business/earn-more-on-projects/)

Although I've never been convinced that fixing a price for a project up-front is a good idea for either party, I think there are some interesting ideas in this article e.g. "value-based pricing" and "positioning the price as an investment, not an expense". <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [MVCli](https://github.com/cowboyd/mvcli)

One of the projects that I heard about at [Lone Star Ruby Conference](http://lonestarruby.org/2013/lsrc), it's basically a "Rails for CLI applications". If the description is accurate it sounds suspiciously like over-engineering to me, and the README is unhelpfully empty, but maybe one of you could check it out and let me know if there's a spark of something interesting there? <%= by('james-adam') %>


### [PairProgramWith.me](http://www.pairprogramwith.me/)

Another of the strong themes at LSRC was pair programming, and in particular remote pair programming. This site was promoted by [Avdi Grimm](http://avdi.org/) in his closing keynote, but I also met [Mark Simm](http://twitter.com/marksim) who spoke about [#pairwithme](http://blog.quarternotecoda.com/blog/2013/07/20/the-number-pairwithme-progression/). I'm hoping to make some time available soon to pair with new people. <%= by('james-adam') %>

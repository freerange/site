Week 287 - Interesting links
============================

### [Google Adds Support for Bitcoin Conversion](http://googlesystem.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/google-adds-support-for-bitcoin.html)

You can now search Google for, for example, "1 btc in gbp" and learn that it's currently worth £359.76. I'm sure I tried this just recently and the functionality wasn't available, so I was interested to see it announced yesterday. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Distance Measurement in the New Google Maps](http://googlesystem.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/distance-measurement-in-new-google-maps.html)

I'm happy to see the reappearance of this functionality in Google Maps. I used to use it to plan runs/walks and never really settled on a good alternative so it's great to have it back. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Rubyforge closing down](https://twitter.com/evanphx/status/399552820380053505)

I think it's a bit sad how this has been handled. Maybe I've missed them, but there doesn't appear to have been a lot of "publicity" that this was going to happen nor anything about _why_ it's happening.

The shutdown has meant that a bunch of URLs are now broken. It feels as if it wouldn't have been too hard to setup some generic redirects or at least provide a mechanism to add such redirects. I'm sure the Ruby community would've been willing to help - I know [we](/) would be happy to help. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [DWP awards Atos £10 million IT contract for healthcare assessments](http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/public-sector/3530443/dwp-awards-atos-10-million-it-contract-for-healthcare-assessments/)

The ongoing shambles of IT procurement at DWP doesn't fill me with confidence that their [Credit Union Expansion Project](https://github.com/freerange/bank/wiki/Credit-Union-Expansion-Project) is going to deliver something useful. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Retractions are coming thick and fast: it's time for publishers to act](http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/jul/14/retractions-journal-publishers-scientific-papers-peer-review)

I thought this was a though-provoking article about the limitations of traditional peer review and how post-publication peer review might be a good way to improve the state of play.

I was particularly interested to read about [PubPeer](https://pubpeer.com/) which provides a way to add a public comment to any published paper with a [Digital Object Identifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier). It's a shame that established academic journal publishers don't seem to recognise the value of post-publication peer review. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Peer to Peer](http://peertopeer.io/)

[Drew Neil](http://drewneil.com/) of [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org/) fame has recently launched a series of interviews where you watch "over the shoulder" of experts solving technical problems. The first in the series is [Counting Tree Nodes with Tom Stuart](http://peertopeer.io/videos/1-tom-stuart/) which I'm sure is well worth the $25. Tom has also written a [follow-up blog post](http://codon.com/notes-on-counting-tree-nodes). <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [How to set up a Workers' Co-op (pdf)](http://www.radicalroutes.org.uk/publicdownloads/setupaworkerscoop-lowres.pdf)

Our recent investigations into [how to set up a credit union](/project-credit-union-day-1) have got me thinking more about whether it might be good to convert [GFR](/) more formally into a co-operative. We looked into this quite a while back, but I _think_ we mainly focussed on whether it was worth [becoming an Limited Liability Partnership](/week-165#to-llp-or-not-to-llp) c.f. John Lewis.

I'm not sure how seriously we considered setting up an [Industrial & Provident Society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_provident_society) which is the recommended legal structure for a workers' co-op. In any case, I think this pamphlet by [Radical Routes](http://www.radicalroutes.org.uk/) and recommended by [Chris Lowis](http://chrislowis.co.uk) looks very pertinent. <%= by('james-mead') %>

Week 285 - Interesting links
============================

### [Docker on your Server](http://interblah.net/docker-on-your-server)

[James Adam][] has been playing with [Docker][] in the context of running a few different apps on his personal VPS. If there's enough interest, he's going to write an e-book on the subject. If this is something you're interested in, I'd encourage you to [sign up][]. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [QuickMVP](https://quickmvp.com/)

I noticed that James A is using this to test demand for his "Docker on your Server" e-book. It looks as if it offers a bit more than the average "landing page" service. Maybe worth a bit more of a look. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Split ticket finder](http://split.traintimes.org.uk/)

I'm not sure how long this website by the prolific [Matthew Somerville][] has been live, but it's great. He explains:

> The railway's national fares database is a very complicated affair, built up over many years and dealing with an extraordinary array of restrictions and conditions. This means that it is easily possible for two or more tickets to act identically to one through ticket, but be substantially cheaper.

If you're a train nerd and you want to get into the nitty gritty, then this [RailUK Fares & Ticketing Guide post][] on split ticketing is essential reading, but the nub of the matter is that it may be cheaper to buy separate tickets for two parts of your journey. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Say Hello to Roundup Roger](http://brewhouse.io/2014/06/27/say-hello-to-roundup-roger.html)

This post on the brewhouse (hi [Kalv][] :-)) blog describes the development of their open source Roundup Roger software. I haven't tried it but it sounds pretty similar to [Team Snippets][] or [iDoneThis][], with the obvious advantage of being open source.

[We][GFR] tried using Team Snippets in the past but didn't stick with it so it'll be interesting to see whether brewhouse continue to find it useful enough to both use and develop. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Fragmentions](https://indiewebcamp.com/fragmention)

We recently discussed the frustration of not being able to link to a specific section of a page that doesn't have sensible anchors. It turns out that the Indieweb community have started working on a way of solving this problem. <%= by('chris-roos') %>

> A fragmention is an experimental extension to a URL to link and cite individual words or phrases of a document using double-hash anchors (##).


### [Demoting Social Silos to Syndication Endpoints: Known and the Future of Ownership, Publishing, and Educational Technology](http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/3393)

This sounds really interesting: Using Indieweb ideas/software to allow students to own the content that they submit to an [LMS][]. <%= by('chris-roos') %>

Wednesday Links - Week 262
==========================

OK. So it's not Wednesday. I know, I know...

### [Say Welcome to the First Open Source Bank Manager!](http://blog.cozycloud.cc/news/2013/12/12/welcome-to-the-first-web-open-source-bank-manager/)

[Cozycloud](https://www.cozycloud.cc/) have announced an app that allows you to interact with a number of banking websites through a simpler, standard interface. I've thought about making something similar in the past so I'm interested to see how this develops. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Healthy benefits for the long run](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3703-healthy-benefits-for-the-long-run)

> We ultimately want 37signals to have the potential of being the last job our people ever need. When you think about what it'll take to keep someone happy and fulfilled for 10, 20, 30 years into the future, you adopt a very different vantage point from our industry norm.

I love what 37 Signals are trying to do here and would love for us to be thinking along similar lines at GFR. Obviously, we're not doing quite so well what with [Tommo](/tom-ward) having disappeared to 37 Signals but I'd like to think we can keep trying. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


###[The IT risks facing Universal Credit](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240212473/Analysis-The-IT-risks-facing-Universal-Credit?vgnextfmt=print)

> "There is no debacle on Universal Credit" insisted Iain Duncan Smith to MPs on the House of Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee.

Although I don't know any of the details, reading this article doesn't fill me with confidence that this project is going to work out   well. In particular I agree with the comments in the article made by Gus Power of [Energized Work][]. I've linked to the print version of the article to spare you all the adverts. <%= by('james-mead') %>


###[Handling Associations on Null Objects](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/handling-associations-on-null-objects)

I wish I'd know about `ActiveRecord::Relation#none` before. This would've been useful in something I was doing only the other day. <%= by('james-mead') %>


###[Programming an ATtiny w/ Arduino 1.0](http://highlowtech.org/?p=1695)

I came across this tutorial by MIT via [How-To: Shrinkify Your Arduino Projects][]. I talked to [James Adam][] some time ago about making a smaller, cheaper version of the electronics for [Printer][] and I reckon this would be a good approach. <%= by('james-mead') %>

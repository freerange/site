Week 506 - Interesting links
============================

### [Space4 Impact: 1 year building Londonâ€™s home for digital co-operatives](https://outlandish.com/blog/co-operatives/space4-impact/)

It's really good to hear that [Space4][], the co-operative co-working and events space in Finsbury Park, is going from strength to strength. We know how hard [Outlandish][], and particularly Polly, have worked to make it a success! Having put a lot of their own resources into the project, they're now keen to find partners who can help them out with cash, publicity and strategic growth. Do [get in touch with them][space4-email] if that might be you! <%= by('james-mead') %>

### [The Rise and Demise of RSS](https://twobithistory.org/2018/09/16/the-rise-and-demise-of-rss.html)

I've started using an RSS feed reader again recently, so I was interested to read this article documenting the history of RSS. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Sprints, marathons and root canals](https://gojko.net/2018/08/30/sprints-marathons-root-canals.html)

This article attempts to answer the following questions: How to prioritise technical debt against business features? How do we convince them that refactoring is important? How can anyone estimate the value of technical stories?

I really agree with the section which suggests "the sprint metaphor has now taken on a dangerous literal meaning". And "if there is a racing metaphor for software product delivery, it would be a marathon, not a sprint".

I was also really interested to read that:

> [Alistair Cockburn][] wrote about finite and infinite games, those that have a clear completion state and those that are played for the purpose of continuing the game. He also categorised games into collaborative or cooperative, concluding that software development is a collaborative infinite game.

I do think it's a bad idea to schedule technical tasks, but I'm not totally convinced about his idea of creating a sustainability budget. <%= by('james-mead') %>

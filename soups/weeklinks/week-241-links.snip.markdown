### [trsst](http://www.trsst.com/)

> looks and feels like twitter but encrypted and anonymized and decentralized and only you hold the keys

While this sounds really interesting, I do wonder if they'll be able to hide away the complexities of the public key infrastructure to make it compelling to non-techy users. I'm also intrigued by how decentralised it'll actually be: It'd be great if one of their goals was to make it super simple to host your own home server, rather than having to rely on a few (or maybe even one) provider. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Build a DIY Rotating Time Lapse Tripod Head](http://photo.tutsplus.com/tutorials/hardware-tutorials/build-a-diy-rotating-time-lapse-tripod-head/)

I love this idea of using a rotating kitchen timer along with my old Samsung S2 to take moving time lapse photos. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Five Successful Startups That Started As Blogs](http://www.fastcolabs.com/3015976/why-these-5-successful-startups-started-as-blogs)

The most intriguing of these for me is [Groupon](http://www.groupon.co.uk/), as it's definitely advice [we've](/) given in the past: If the most important part of your product is the content then do whatever's quickest to get that content into the world (using [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/), for example), and iterate once it's out there. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [A Closer Look at How Ruby Object Mapper Works](http://solnic.eu/2013/08/26/a-closer-look-at-how-ruby-object-mapper-works.html)

I'm interested in alternatives to ActiveRecord which make it easier to reduce coupling between your domain models and your persistence mechanism. This project seems promising. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Getting Hexagonal with Wisper, a listener Framework for Ruby](http://devblog.reverb.com/post/57704562313/getting-hexagonal-with-wisper-a-listener-framework-for)

I'm also interested in pub/sub listener techniques for decoupling your business logic from Rails, although I'm not totally convinced I like the syntax of Wisper. <%= by('james-mead') %>

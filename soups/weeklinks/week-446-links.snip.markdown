Week 446 - Interesting links
============================

### [Learn Vue 2: Step By Step](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step/)

I've been working though these tutorials on the JavaScript framework [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Each episode is short, practically focussed and well presented. It's also been very beneficial to see other people attempt the exercises and share them in the comments. It would be great if each episode included the source code but I'm really impressed by the quality of this free resource. <%= by('chris-lowis') %>

### [direnv -- Unclutter your .profile](https://direnv.net/)

This looks like a neat alternative to the Ruby-specific [dotenv][dotenv]. It allows for per-directory shell environment settings without requiring you to add another Gem to your project. Via [this recent Unboxed Roundup][unboxed-roundup]. <%= by('chris-roos') %>

### [Visualising transparency, for AllTrials / mySociety](https://www.mysociety.org/2017/08/02/visualising-transparency-for-alltrials/)

I saw Ben Goldacre speak about All Trials quite a few years ago but hadn't really heard anything about it since. I'm pleased to hear that the work has been continuing and the results are now available. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Rubyforge redirects](https://github.com/tomstuart/rubyforge-redirects)

Rubyforge was [shutdown about 4 years ago][rubyforge-shutdown], which led to [Tom Stuart][] starting this project. Sometime later, [Ruby Central][] were persuaded to setup redirects for some of the projects whose documentation used to live on rubyforge.org.

Many blog posts and even gem pages still link to rubyforge.org URLs, e.g. the "Documentation" link on the [Rack gem page][rack-gem]. So I was disappointed to [notice][copeland-tweet] the other day that these redirects seem to have disappeared. Indeed, although Ruby Central still seem to own the domain, the domain isn't responding to HTTP traffic at all.

I've tried contacting Ruby Central folk via Twitter and [email][ruby-central-email] to see whether they'd be open to the idea of a community-led project (like Tom's) taking over the domain to keep these URLs alive, but I haven't had any reply.

As Tim Berners-Lee said: [Cool URIs don't change][cool-uris]. And as Tom wrote, it would be a [waste][tom-why] if all rubyforge.org URLs died.

### [Commit bit](https://github.com/cucumber/commitbit)

The [Cucumber][] folk have come up with this interesting service to help manage open-source projects on GitHub. The service integrates with GitHub and hands out commit privileges to anyone who gets a pull request accepted. The idea is that this reduces the workload of the existing team and lowers the barrier of entry for new team members. <%= by('james-mead') %>

### [Applying Lean Techniques to Improve Software Engineering Education [pdf]](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rbc/papers/icse-seet-17.pdf)

I haven't had a chance to read it yet, but I was pleased to see that [Rob Chatley][] and his co-author have published this paper on applying lean techniques to their course at Imperial College, London. This is something Rob has talked about a few times at our [Show & Tell events][]. <%= by('james-mead') %>

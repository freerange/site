Week 458 - Interesting links
============================

### [Learning from the design of railway systems](https://projectsbyif.com/blog/learning-from-the-design-of-railway-systems)

I really enjoyed reading this article by Nat Buckley, particularly the bit about "making mistakes impossible (or at least unlikely)". The last time I travelled on the [Cumbrian Coast line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbrian_Coast_line) from Carlisle to Whitehaven (some years ago), they were still using a physical token passed from the signalman to the driver to control access to the sections of single track. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Git for Humans â€“ Alice Bartlett at UX Brighton 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWxxfttcMts&feature=youtu.be)

In this talk I think Alice does a great job of demystifying `git` to an audience of designers. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Don't Design Your Emails](https://www.gkogan.co/blog/dont-design-emails/)

I was pleased to read that "plain emails not only save time but work better". This article describes a trial in which half the recipients received an HTML email and the other half a plain text email. The plain text email had 3.3 times more clicks than the HTML email! <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Termux](https://termux.com/)

I've been playing with Termux on my phone. "Termux is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app that works directly with no rooting or setup required". I've also installed the [Hackers Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard&hl=en_GB) to make it easier to type escape characters and use modifier keys. I have no idea what I'm going to do with this, but it's certainly fun to run emacs and an `irb` session on the bus. <%= by('chris-lowis') %>


### [Signal K](http://signalk.org)

Marine instrumentation has historically been proprietary and overly expensive. So I'm pleased to see a group of developers setup this free and open-source data exchange standard to compete with the proprietary ones. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Ambient Shipping](https://github.com/marcdacosta/ambient-shipping)

This project captures AIS messages broadcast by passing ships to obtain identity, position, course & speed, and joins the data up with public data sets that reveal what the ships are carrying. Very cool! <%= by('james-mead') %>

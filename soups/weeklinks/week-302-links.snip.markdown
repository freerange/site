Week 302 - Interesting links
============================

### [Whatfettle ‚Åì One CSV, thirty stories](http://blog.whatfettle.com/2014/10/13/one-csv-thirty-stories/)

I've really enjoyed following Paul's posts about digging into some Land Registry data. I particularly like the use of common unix utilities, including sed and awk, to explore the data. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### ["Did you mean?" Experience in Ruby](http://www.yukinishijima.net/2014/10/21/did-you-mean-experience-in-ruby.html)

This looks like it could come in useful: Misspell a method name in Ruby and it'll suggest some likely alternatives. I've had a really quick play with it and it seems to work well. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [GitHub Pages For The Rest Of Us](http://blog.jonudell.net/2014/10/21/github-pages-for-the-rest-of-us/)

I've been thinking about using GitHub Pages but editing on GitHub to get a wiki like experience for a while now. It's somewhat reassuring to read about someone else using it in this way. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Why we retired the feedly URL shortener](http://blog.feedly.com/2014/10/28/feedly-url-shortener-retired/)

> As part of the feedly web and mobile 24 update, we retired the feedly URL shortener. It felt like the right thing to do for users and makes us a better citizen of the Web.

I can't imagine this was an easy decision to make but it certainly feels like the right thing to do. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [New Google+ Share Button](http://googlesystem.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/new-google-share-button.html)

I noticed this new Google Plus share button a couple of days ago and had to do a double take as it looks very similar to a [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com) plus (+) icon. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Mozilla Science Lab](http://collaborate.mozillascience.org/)

The bits of academia with which I've come into contact didn't seem to collaborate much on software. Hopefully this can help. Via [Tom Hall](http://www.thattommyhall.com/). <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Info pages: publishing data about user needs and metrics](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2014/10/29/info-pages-publishing-data-about-user-needs-and-metrics/)

It's brilliant that GOV.UK is opening up data like this. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [oathtool](http://www.nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/oathtool.1.html)

I installed this on my laptop today and successfully used it to generate [TOTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm) codes for our Amazon Web Services account. It's nice not to have to rely on the Google Authenticator app on my mobile phone. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [From NAND to Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/)

I'm looking forward to working through this book with other members of the [London Computation Club](http://london.computation.club/). <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [The Web, Annotated](https://hypothes.is/)

This is an ambitious-sounding project to develop an open collaborative platform for annotating the web using the excellent [Annotator project](http://okfnlabs.org/projects/annotator/). <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [AdNauseam](http://dhowe.github.io/AdNauseam/)

This made me laugh. It's a browser plugin that automatically clicks on *all* adverts indiscriminantly so that "as the data gathered shows an omnivorous click-stream, user profiling, targeting and surveillance becomes futile". Via [Matt Valentine-House](http://www.eightbitraptor.com/). <%= by('james-mead') %>

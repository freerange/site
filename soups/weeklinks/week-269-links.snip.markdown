Week 269 - Interesting links
============================

### [Indieweb Homebrew website club meeting in London](http://indiewebcamp.com/events/2014-03-19-homebrew-website-club)

Taken from the event page itself:

> Are you building your own website? Indie reader? Personal publishing web app? Or some other digital magic-cloud proxy? If so, come on by and join a gathering of people with likeminded interests. Bring your friends that want to start a personal web site. Exchange information, swap ideas, talk shop, help work on a project, whatever...

We're hosting this at our office next Wednesday (19th March) so please do come along if the paragraph above sounds interesting. {by chris-roos}


### [QuickCast. Make. Publish. Share. 3 Minute Screencasts](http://quickcast.io/)

I had a quick play with this when I was recording the screencast to demonstrate the [FreeAgent transaction helper][]. While it certainly does what it says, I couldn't see any real benefit over recording the screencast with QuickTime Player and hosting that on a service of my choosing (Google Drive in my case). I can see that the automatic creation of gifs could be useful, but they weren't generated for my screencast as it was over the maximum size. {by chris-roos}


### [A Walk Through Time With C A Mathew | Spitalfields Life](http://spitalfieldslife.com/2014/03/07/a-walk-through-time-with-c-a-mathew/)

Great photos taken nearly 100 years apart and merged together. I love those where the people appear to see each other over the gap of time.

I don't know if it's the same artist but these are similar to the ["London now and then" photos on the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-26339275). {by chris-roos}

### [Test-Driven Development (that's not what we meant) [video]](https://vimeo.com/83960706)

So far I've only watched about half of this talk by Steve Freeman, but along with the [slides](http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-berlin-2013/slides/SteveFreeman_TestDrivenDevelopmentThatsNotWhatWeMeant.pdf) it seems to contain some useful insights into test-driven development. {by james-mead}


### [Slow Tests Are the Symptom, Not the Cause](http://re-factor.com/blog/2013/09/27/slow-tests-are-the-symptom-not-the-cause/)

Although I'm not sure I agree with all the details of this article, I do agree with the title and much of the sentiment within it. {by james-mead}


### [Transitioning Persona to Community Ownership](http://identity.mozilla.com/post/78873831485/transitioning-persona-to-community-ownership)

It's a shame that Mozilla are no longer putting development effort into [Persona](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/) and [Browser ID](http://identity.mozilla.com/post/7616727542/introducing-browserid-a-better-way-to-sign-in). Hopefully the community will keep pushing it forward. {by james-mead}


### [Empathy: A Handbook for Revolution](http://www.romankrznaric.com/empathy-a-handbook-for-revolution)

I've [previously mentioned](/week-242-links#assume-good-faithhttpenwikipediaorgwikiwikipediaassumegoodfaith) how important it is to see things from other people's point of view. Although I haven't read it yet, this book and the associated [Empathy Library](http://empathylibrary.com/) caught my eye. {by james-mead}


### [blame_parent](https://github.com/chancancode/blame_parent)

The GitHub blame view has links in the left hand margin to the last commit where a given line was changed. This Chrome Extension adds a `^` link alongside those commit links so you can navigate to a blame view for the same file, but at the commit before the one where the change was made. This makes it easier to find the commits which have affected a given line of code. {by james-mead}

Week 284 - Interesting links
============================

### [Broccoli: First Beta Release](http://www.solitr.com/blog/2014/02/broccoli-first-release/)

This is an interesting new alternative to the Rails asset pipeline which runs on [node.js][]. A nice example of one of its plugins is the [es6-concatenator][broccoli-es6-concatenator] which is a "shim" for [ECMAScript 6 imports][ecmascript-6-import-declaration]. Via [Tom Stuart][]. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [The CRAPL: An academic-strength open source license](http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/)

I applaud anything that encourages academics to release the source code connected to their research - it's crazy that this is still the exception and not the rule. However, I can't help wondering that if the majority of software is "stapled together on a tight deadline; and it's not pretty code", then perhaps the majority of academic software is full of bugs which invalidate the research conclusions. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/)

This allows people to offer a bounty for work on specific open-source features and bugs. I like the fact that you can post a bounty by just referencing a GitHub issue URL. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [I fought the law and the users won: delivering online voter registration](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/06/20/i-fought-the-law-and-the-users-won-delivering-online-voter-registration/)

This is a great (and unfortunately rare) example of inter-disciplinary collaboration and it's particularly brilliant that they got some laws *changed* while developing the service. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Introducing the new Gmail API](http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/introducing-new-gmail-api.html)

We keep thinking of trying to automate more of our administrivia and much of it happens via email. I'm hoping that this newly released [Gmail API][] might allow us to write scripts to handle some of the more mundane tasks. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Gas Mask - Hosts file manager for OS X](https://github.com/2ndalpha/gasmask)

This is a handy little Mac utility that makes it slightly easier to manage your `/etc/hosts` file. I came across it recently while I was migrating some of our apps from one server to another. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [GitHub: A better branches page](https://github.com/blog/1852-a-better-branches-page)

GitHub announce their improved Branches page:

> New sections on the page also make it more obvious how you need to take action on the branches in your repository—whether that’s cleaning up stale branches

I think this is a great improvement, particularly highlighting the stale branches that can be deleted. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Code Spaces have been forced to close](http://www.codespaces.com/)

I hadn't heard of Code Spaces until James mentioned them to me. It's pretty scary that an entire business can be brought down by a malicious individual. I wonder what would happen if they find the person responsible - would they be punishable in a similar fashion to someone that destroyed a traditional bricks and mortar business? <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Makies FabLab: Design, Create & Style Doll Fashion Maker](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/makies-fablab-design-create/id806174619?mt=8)

Congratulations to Makie for their [recently launched][FabLab tweet] iOS FabLab game.

Actually, it's double congratulations because they've just [announced that Makies are in the Hamleys Magnificent seven must-have toys for Christmas 2014][Makie Hamleys tweet]! Great stuff. <%= by('chris-roos') %>

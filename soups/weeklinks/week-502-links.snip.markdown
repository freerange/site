Week 502 - Interesting links
============================

### [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co/)

I recently came across this couple who [live aboard a sailing boat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIJodhT0Bow), sail it all over the world, and run a design & games studio on board. I particularly liked [the look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gifzjhyBwOc&t=15s) of [ronin](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Ronin), a terminal-based graphic design tool ("a combination of vim and Photoshop") which they built out of some necessity when one of their laptops died. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Bus Times: Bus stops, routes and times](https://bustimes.org/)

I discovered this excellent website while I was on holiday in Cornwall last month. Nice simple, clean pages like [this timetable for the Penzance to Lands End route](https://bustimes.org/services/a1-penzance-st-buryan-treen-lands-end). So much better than all the unusable PDFs found on invidivual bus company websites! <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Refresh](https://refresh.study/)

I really like some of the ideas in this prototype of a browser based on Safari, particularly the functionality making it easier to manage a large number of open tabs. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Richard D. Wolff Lecture on Worker Coops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1WUKahMm1s)

I thoroughly enjoyed this talk by a [Marxian economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxian_economics), particularly [this bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1WUKahMm1s#t=29m57s) where he does some "economic arithmetic". <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Has the Government Digital Service been successful?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEmTzWXES_0)

An interesting panel discussion with Mike Bracken, Martha-Lane Fox, Ian Watmore & Daniel Thornton. <%= by('james-mead') %>

Monday Links - Week 243
==================

### [Chrome for Android's Find in Page Icon](http://googlesystem.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/chrome-for-androids-special-find-in-page.html)

I never knew about this "Find in page" functionality on Chrome for Android. In fact, even after reading this post I still managed to fail to use it the first couple of times, until I read/realised that I needed to click on the icon instead of the text. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Set the Desktop Picture to NASA Image of the Day](http://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/examples/ex08/03.html)

I've never used the Mac Automator before so I was pleased to find this post that walked me through creating a workflow to download an image and automatically set it as my background. I've amended the workflow to point to an [ATOM feed of latest images of the Thames, and have that running every 15 minutes with cron](http://chrisroos.co.uk/blog/2013-09-09-automatically-updating-my-desktop-background-from-my-thames-time-lapse-pictures). The result is that I get to see what my camera can see out of my bedroom window. Which is schweeeeet. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Confident Ruby](http://www.confidentruby.com/)

I was subscribed to Avdi's [Ruby Tapas](http://www.rubytapas.com/) for a while and this book looks like it's full of similar useful tidbits - it reminds me a lot of a Ruby equivalent of Kent Beck's [Implementation Patterns](http://www.informit.com/title/0321413091). <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [My First Feature and Beyond: Why I Work At Facebook](http://www.amiando.com/kent-beck-fb-london.html)

Talking of Kent Beck, I'm attending this talk by him at Facebook, London, tomorrow night. Unfortunately the event is full-up - they're not accepting any more registrations. <%= by('james-mead') %>

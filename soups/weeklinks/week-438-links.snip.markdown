Week 438 - Interesting links
============================

### [Still Blogging in 2017](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/05/03/Blogging-in-2017)

Tim Bray explains why he continues to blog in 2017. This paragraph in particular resonated with me.

> The great dan­ger is that the Web’s fu­ture is mall-like: No space re­al­ly pub­lic, no store­fronts but na­tion­al brands’, no vi­su­als com­posed by am­a­teurs, noth­ing that’s on of­fer just for its own sake, and for love.

Reading these sort of posts make me want to write/post more.

### [Fuck Facebook](https://daringfireball.net/2017/06/fuck_facebook)

John Gruber builds on [Dave Winer's reasons for not linking to Facebook](http://scripting.com/2017/05/31.html#a110526) with this passionate post about how Facebook is against the open web.

> Treat Facebook as the private walled garden that it is. If you want something to be publicly accessible, post it to a real blog on any platform that embraces the real web, the open one.

As someone without an account I'm somewhat fascinated by the fact that Facebook is essentially invisible to me for the reasons mentioned in these posts. A quick search suggests that there are nearly 2 billion active Facebook users and yet I've essentially never seen anything that they've created.

### [Deserter Election Manifesto](https://deserter.co.uk/2017/06/deserter-election-manifesto-revealed/)

This is a manifesto I can get behind! Mostly because "The potato will be allowed into the ‘five-a-day’ club" :-)

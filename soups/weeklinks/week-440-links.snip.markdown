Week 440 - Interesting links
============================

### [Crisp: Happiness Index](http://dna.crisp.se/docs/happiness-index.html)

Crisp are a self-organising consulting company based in Stockholm, Sweden. They use a "happiness index" as their primary metric that they use to make decisions about the direction of the company. This is very similar to an idea we've kicked around at [Go Free Range][] from time to time. I was interested to see that they've split out separate scores for client and non-client work. {by james-mead}

### [Pinboard acquires Delicious](https://blog.pinboard.in/2017/06/pinboard_acquires_delicious/)

This isn't exactly hot off the press, but since it came as quite a surprise to me, I thought I'd mention it. As a heavy user of the original del.icio.us website, I was very sad to see what became of it after it was sold by Yahoo. Anyway, kudos to [Maciej Cegłowski][] for his relentless focus on providing [the best bookmarking service][pinboard] (other than [Roosmarks][], obviously!). {by james-mead}

Week 440 - Interesting links
============================

### [Crisp: Happiness Index](http://dna.crisp.se/docs/happiness-index.html)

Crisp are a self-organising consulting company based in Stockholm, Sweden. They use a "happiness index" as their primary metric that they use to make decisions about the direction of the company. This is very similar to an idea we've kicked around at [Go Free Range][] from time to time. I was interested to see that they've split out separate scores for client and non-client work. {by james-mead}

### [Pinboard acquires Delicious](https://blog.pinboard.in/2017/06/pinboard_acquires_delicious/)

This isn't exactly hot off the press, but since it came as quite a surprise to me, I thought I'd mention it. As a heavy user of the original del.icio.us website, I was very sad to see what became of it after it was sold by Yahoo. Anyway, kudos to [Maciej Cegłowski][] for his relentless focus on providing [the best bookmarking service][pinboard] (other than [Roosmarks][], obviously!). {by james-mead}

### [Examples of governing documents / handbooks / constitutions](https://community.coops.tech/t/examples-of-governing-documents-handbooks-constitutions/101)

We've been considering revising our company's governing documents and
potentially sharing publicly some of the wiki we use internally so
that other tech co-operatives can learn from how we work. I started
this thread over on the CoTech community discussion forum to collect
examples from other organisations. {by chris-lowis}

### [99 Bottles of OOP](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/)

I've been working through Sandi Metz and Katrina Owen's book "99
Bottles of OOP" in the last week. It's a very well-written exploration
of practical test-driven development and refactoring. Metz and Owen
refer throughout
to [design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
and [refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html)
patterns and how they can be used to address "code smells". This in
particular made me think about our recent work refactoring an
application for a client and how having a common language for
describing a refactoring helps to keep individual chunks of work (for
example in pull requests) self-contained. {by chris-lowis}

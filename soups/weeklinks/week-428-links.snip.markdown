Week 428 - Interesting links
============================

### [Git hosting for Co-operators](https://git.coop)

Our fellow [CoTech][]ers at the [Webarchitects Coop][] have set up this GitLab instance for use by members of their cooperative. You can join as an individual or an organisation by investing as little as Â£1. [Go Free Range][] is in the process of joining and we're planning to help them test the service. {by james-mead}

### [A Fatal Mistake | The Sinking of the El Faro](https://newengland.com/yankee-magazine/living/profiles/el-faro/)

This is a bit random, but I was pretty amazed to read this account of the relatively recent loss of a container ship with all hands in these days of sophisticated weather forecasting. {by james-mead}


### [Government organisation register](http://government-organisation.alpha.openregister.org/)

Finding a canonical list of government organisations was something I remember wrestling with when [we built][inside-government] the [GOV.UK Whitehall app][], so it's interesting to see this new [register][] with [Neil Williams][] as its custodian. {by james-mead}

### [Learn to code electronic music tools with JavaScript](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/electronic-music-tools)

I'm enjoying participating in
this [FutureLearn](https://futurelearn.com) course from Goldsmith's
University. I've been involved with the development of
the [Web Audio API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/) for a
long time and it's exciting for me to see it being used in classroom
teaching. As a former employee of FutureLearn it's also fun to be
taking a course "from the other side". {by chris-lowis}


### [Reinventing Organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/)

I've been reading Frederic Laloux's book "Reinventing Organizations"
after hearing an interview with the author
on
[Ricardo Semler's podcast](http://podcast.leadwise.co/s1e03-reinventing-organizations-with-frederic-laloux). I'm
not sure I fully buy in to the evolutionary arguments put forward in
the book, but the detailed case studies of different types of
organisations and how they work are fascinating. I particularly
enjoyed learning about the decentralised way
that
[Buurtzorg Neighborhood Nursing](http://www.buurtzorgusa.org/about-us/) in
The Netherlands works. {by chris-lowis}


### [LOOPY: a tool for thinking in systems](http://ncase.me/loopy/)

This project is part of [Explorable Explanations][], a movement to make learning active, not just passive. I found the example simulations pretty mesmerising! Via [Ben G][]. {by james-mead}

Week 428 - Interesting links
============================

### [Git hosting for Co-operators](https://git.coop)

Our fellow [CoTech][]ers at the [Webarchitects Coop][] have set up this GitLab instance for use by members of their cooperative. You can join as an individual or an organisation by investing as little as Â£1. [Go Free Range][] is in the process of joining and we're planning to help them test the service. {by james-mead}

### [A Fatal Mistake | The Sinking of the El Faro](https://newengland.com/yankee-magazine/living/profiles/el-faro/)

This is a bit random, but I was pretty amazed to read this account of the relatively recent loss of a container ship with all hands in these days of sophisticated weather forecasting. {by james-mead}


### [Government organisation register](http://government-organisation.alpha.openregister.org/)

Finding a canonical list of government organisations was something I remember wrestling with when [we built][inside-government] the [GOV.UK Whitehall app][], so it's interesting to see this new [register][] with [Neil Williams][] as its custodian. {by james-mead}

### [LOOPY: a tool for thinking in systems](http://ncase.me/loopy/)

This project is part of [Explorable Explanations][], a movement to make learning active, not just passive. I found the example simulations pretty mesmerising! Via [Ben G][]. {by james-mead}

Week 292 - Interesting links
============================

### [Sandstorm - Personal Cloud Platform](https://sandstorm.io/)

This project is aiming to make it much easier to host web apps on your own server:

> No command lines, no configuration files. Apps are installed through an app-store-like web interface. And, most importantly, every app runs in a separate secure sandbox, so an evil app cannot take down your server.

They've already lined up a decent list of apps - WordPress, Etherpad, Ethercalc, ShareLaTeX, Mailpile, Roundcube, Ghost, Tiny Tiny RSS, and [even Apache Wave](https://blog.sandstorm.io/news/2014-08-20-apache-wave.html)!

The project's lead developer is an ex-Google engineer, Kenton Varda, the primary author of [Protocol Buffers](http://protobuf.googlecode.com/), so it's got a bit of credibility. I really like the sound of it and so I've backed [their Indiegogo project](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sandstorm-io-personal-cloud-platform). <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Guacamole](http://guac-dev.org/)

An open-source client-less remote desktop gateway, supporting standard protocols like VNC and RDP. They call it client-less, because it's all based on HTML5 i.e. no browser plugins are required. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [iOS WebKit Debug Proxy](https://github.com/google/ios-webkit-debug-proxy)

This allows developers to inspect Mobile Safari on iOS devices via the [Chrome DevTools UI](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/) using the [WebKit Remote Debugging Protocol](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging). This sounds as if it would be particularly useful for [investigating scenarios where Safari crashes](http://devcoma.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/how-to-investigate-ios-safari-crashes.html). <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Not Just Code Monkeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8aECe4lp44)

I'm probably a bit late coming to this video, but I think Martin Fowler makes a number of good points about our responsibilities as developers. He covers a broad swathe of topics - from over-the-wall engineering and [bad UI patterns](http://darkpatterns.org/), to [Datensparsamkeit](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Datensparsamkeit.html), social justice, and diversity.

I often struggle to make it through videos of conference talks, but I found this very engaging and I happily watched it to the end. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [How to hire a bike in London](http://codon.com/how-to-hire-a-bike-in-london)

Tom's little rant against the appalling user experience of hiring a TFL bike is very amusing and it's a prime example of a _dark pattern_ as mentioned by Martin Fowler (in the video above). <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Hextris](http://hextris.github.io/hextris/)

I quite enjoyed killing a few minutes playing this little Tetris-like game. What I mainly enjoy is that it's written entirely in JavaScript! <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Great Train Journeys: London Bridge to Charing Cross](http://deserter.co.uk/2014/08/great-train-journeys-london-bridge-to-charing-cross/)

I really enjoyed reading this post shared by [Paul](http://po-ru.com/). The title suggested to me that it was going to be a bit of a joke, but it actually contains some useful pointers to areas that people may not have noticed. I certainly didn't known about Lower Robert Street before reading this. <%= by('chris-roos') %>

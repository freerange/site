Week 304 - Interesting links
============================

### [Simian Army](https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy)

I remember reading about Netflix's Chaos Monkey a few years back, but I hadn't appreciated that it had been [released into the wild][Chaos Monkey open sourced]. Given that it's very focussed on [Amazon Web Services][], it might be interesting to use some of it (or at least the idea behind it) to mess with [our video service][GFR Video]. More importantly I enjoyed discovering the name of [this method][doMonkeyBusiness]. {by james-mead}


### [Cubify Quadcopter](http://cubify.com/en/Store/Quadcopter)

These [STL][] files would allow us to print the main components of a quadcopter on the [CubeX printer][] which we have on loan from [Makie][]. Now all we need is to find some time to print them. Via [Ben Griffiths][]. {by james-mead}


### [Captioning with Plover and Vim](http://plover.stenoknight.com/2014/11/captioning-with-plover-and-vim.html)

I really like the _idea_ of being able to "type" words this fast, but I know I'm unlikely to get round to learning how to do it. However, that doesn't stop me from admiring the skill of those who have mastered the art. {by james-mead}


### [Sink or swim: a short story about failure demand and first world problems](http://blog.mattedgar.com/2014/11/09/sink-or-swim-a-short-story-about-failure-demand/)

This article isn't particularly remarkable, but it did make me realise quite how common-place [Failure Demand][] is. Also I followed a link from the article and ended up purchasing John Seddon's new book, [The WHITEHALL Effect][]. {by james-mead}


### [Two-Factor Authentication with Authy](https://www.authy.com/)

James mentioned this back in the [links for week 288][] but I've only recently started to use it. I've added a couple of accounts and really appreciate being able to get the 2FA code from my computer rather than having to reach for my phone. {by chris-roos}


### [Free My Data](http://freemydata.co/)

The folks at [Known][] have created this useful directory containing instructions for getting your data out of some of the main social networks and websites. {by chris-roos}

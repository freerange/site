Week 316 - Interesting links
============================

### [Snowdrift.coop](https://snowdrift.coop/)

This non-profit member-owned cooperative describes itself as "a matching patronage system funding freely-licensed works". I'm intrigued by this attempt to [combine the benefits of the Proprietary and the Open Source models](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/w/en/intro). <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)

I'd always ignored Google's Cloud Computing offering, because I thought their [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) was limited to using only Python, Java or (more recently) Go.

However, I recently read a couple of articles saying that [Google's pricing compared favourably with that of AWS](http://www.rightscale.com/blog/cloud-cost-analysis/google-slashes-cloud-prices-google-vs-aws-price-comparison) and that they have a simpler discount mechanism than [EC2 Reserved Instances](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/reserved-instances/).

Anyway, this encouraged me to read a bit more about their [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) and discovered that they support a couple of easy-to-deploy Ruby "stacks". Anyway, it seems clear that I should be considering Google as an alternative to AWS. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Goldman prepares to muscle in on the lending innovation designed to sideline banks](https://theconversation.com/goldman-prepares-to-muscle-in-on-the-lending-innovation-designed-to-sideline-banks-37000)

It's a bit depressing that "big" banks are moving into the P2P lending space. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [LibreBoard](http://git.libreboard.com/libreboard/libreboard/blob/master/README.md)

I came across this open-source alternative to [Trello](https://trello.com) while perusing [the apps](https://sandstorm.io/apps/) being made available on the Sandstorm platform. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Minimum Viable Blockchain](https://www.igvita.com/2014/05/05/minimum-viable-block-chain/)

I found this to be a very clear explanation of the properties and benefits of the block chain mechamism underlying crypto-currencies. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Pairing with Junior Developers](https://devmynd.com/blog/2015-1-pairing-with-junior-developers)

Sarah Mei's top 5 recommendations for mid-level or senior developers pairing with junior developers. Very insightful. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Erowid Recruiter](https://twitter.com/erowidrecruiter)

A Markov-powered mashup of [Erowid trip reports](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/) and tech recruiter emails. It comes up with some amazing tweets! <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [ScrapingHub](http://scrapinghub.com/)

A platform for deploying and running web crawlers. The [Crawlera](http://scrapinghub.com/crawlera/) service looks particularly interesting from the point of view of avoiding being banned when doing regular scraping of a site. <%= by('james-mead') %>

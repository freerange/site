Week 270 - Interesting links
============================

### [Microformats | weblog | Getting Started With microformats2](http://microformats.org/2014/03/05/getting-started-with-microformats2)

This is a great introduction to microformats2 from [Barnaby Walters](http://waterpigs.co.uk/). <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Official Google Blog: Save more with Google Drive](http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/save-more-with-google-drive.html)

> We've lowered the price of our monthly storage plans to $1.99 for 100GB (previously $4.99), $9.99 for 1TB (previously $49.99), and $99.99 for 10TB

This makes Drive quite a bit cheaper than Dropbox for 100GB. Drive is now around £14.33 a year (12 months at $1.99/month) versus Dropbox's £71.93 (12 months at $9.99/month). <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Gitbox — The version control app on a Mac](http://www.gitboxapp.com/)

This git gui for the Mac looks interesting. I've previously dabbled with gitx, gitk and github.app but none of them keep me coming back. Maybe this one would? <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [What browser am I using?](http://www.whatsmybrowser.org/)

This looks good. A potential alternative to [supportdetails.com](http://supportdetails.com/). One difference between the services appears to be that this gives you a URL you can give to people, while supportdetails.com relies on you exporting the data or emailing it from the interface. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Google News Archive Search](http://news.google.com/newspapers)

This is fascinating. A searchable archive of old newspapers. I just searched for "Ramsgate" and discovered articles in Canadian papers from the second world war when the Granville Hotel was temporarily converted to a Canadian hospital. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [9,125 days later](http://adactio.com/journal/6712/)

This is a great article by [Jeremy Keith][]. I'll give you a little taster but recommend reading it in full. 

> That’s another killer feature of the web: you don’t need anyone else. You can publish to this world-changing creation without asking anyone for permission. I wish it were easier for people to do this: entrusting your heritage to the Yahoos and Pownces of the world is seductively simple …but only in the short term. <%= by('chris-roos') %>

Week 322 - Interesting links
============================

### [Experiments with Strengthening JavaScript](https://developers.google.com/v8/experiments)

The Chrome V8 team have been exploring some ways to mitigate post-ES6 performance and usability issues, including a [Strong Mode](https://developers.google.com/v8/experiments#strong) for the language and an optional type system, [SoundScript](https://developers.google.com/v8/experiments#sound). <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Gogs](https://try.gogs.io/)

A painless self-hosted Git service written in Go. I seem to remember spending ages trying to set up my own Git server ages ago. This looks as if it might've made life a bit easier. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Computers in Spaceflight: The NASA Experience](http://history.nasa.gov/computers/contents.html)

I came to this while reading about [Voyager's computer system](http://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch6-2.html). I was particularly fascinated by some of the failure recovery stories, e.g.

> When the backup came on-line it had no record of the gyro readings. Not knowing how bad things were was a blessing, as it executed a simple orientation and stopped the spacecraft roll.

Interesting stuff! <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Nokia 5110 Graphic LCD 84x48](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10168)

[Ben G](https://twitter.com/beng) recommended this as a nice cheap display for a Raspberry Pi. I've just bought [one from Hobbytronics](http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/lcd/nokia-5110-lcd) for the princely sum of Â£7.00 to incorporate into my SDR/AIS project. Now I just need to work out how to wire it up. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Democracy Club CVs](http://cv.democracyclub.org.uk/)

Francis Irving is [aiming to collect the Curriculum Vitae of everyone standing for parliament](http://www.flourish.org/2015/03/why-im-collecting-every-mp-candidates-cv/) which seems like a very worthwile project. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Bidding farewell to Google Code](http://google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html)

It didn't come as a huge surprise that Google Code is shutting down: It doesn't seem to have received much love over the years. One good thing is that you appear to be able to [set a new URL for your code and to have users redirected automatically][google-code-redirect]. This is what Tom Stuart's trying to get Rubyforge to do since shutting the service (see [rubyforge-redirects][]). <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Highrise attempt to fix infinite scrolling](http://blog.highrisehq.com/post/112136637101/snapback-cache-a-huge-improvement-to-the-speed)

We haven't used Highrise for a while now but I still find it interesting to read what they're up to. I was particularly pleased to read that they've attempted to fix the infuriating problem inherent in lots of infinite scroll implementations. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Peer to Peer: Work with Agile Coach Amy Wagner](http://peertopeer.io/blog/2015/work-with-agile-coach-amy-wagner/)

> Are you someone who is kicking off a new digital product or project? Or do you have a project already running that needs improvement? Would you like some free help from Agile Coach Amy Wagner (in exchange for free help, you will be filmed)?

[Peer to Peer][] are expanding their video series to include things other than coding. The first video is going to be hosted by Amy and they're looking for a volunteer to join her. Get in touch if you're interested. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Meat Club iPad app](https://plus.google.com/+RyanSnyderme/posts/e4AyzYHkcjW?cfem=1)

I'm really pleased to see that Ryan and Dietrich have released their [Meat Club iPad app][]. If you're interested in learning how to prepare meat at home then you should definitely check it out. <%= by('chris-roos') %>

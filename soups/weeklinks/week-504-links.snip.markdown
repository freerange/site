Week 504 - Interesting links
============================

### [AWS CDK Developer Preview](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-cdk-developer-preview/)

The [AWS CDK][] allows you to define infrastructure as imperative object-oriented code (e.g. JavaScript, TypeScript, Java) and provision it through [AWS CloudFormation][]. The "Abstract the Details" section says the CDK can "automatically synthesize key resources such as IAM policies, security groups, and network configuration" which sounds pretty handy!

### [A call for the creation of a Trade Union Digital Service](https://outlandish.com/blog/a-call-for-the-creation-of-a-trades-unions-digital-service/)

An article by [Harry R][] of [Outlandish][] and [CoTech][]:

> Business "got" digital 20 years ago, charities got it 10 years ago, and even the government got it five years ago with the creation of the [Government Digital Service][]. The trade union movement needs to engage with digital at a strategic level, not just with ad-hoc tactical use of campaign tools. I call for the (gradual) creation of a Trade Union Digital Service to amplify and co-ordinate our efforts.

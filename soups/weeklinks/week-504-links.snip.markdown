Week 504 - Interesting links
============================

### [AWS CDK Developer Preview](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-cdk-developer-preview/)

The [AWS CDK][] allows you to define infrastructure as imperative object-oriented code (e.g. JavaScript, TypeScript, Java) and provision it through [AWS CloudFormation][]. The "Abstract the Details" section says the CDK can "automatically synthesize key resources such as IAM policies, security groups, and network configuration" which sounds pretty handy!

### [A call for the creation of a Trade Union Digital Service](https://outlandish.com/blog/a-call-for-the-creation-of-a-trades-unions-digital-service/)

An article by [Harry R][] of [Outlandish][] and [CoTech][]:

> Business "got" digital 20 years ago, charities got it 10 years ago, and even the government got it five years ago with the creation of the [Government Digital Service][]. The trade union movement needs to engage with digital at a strategic level, not just with ad-hoc tactical use of campaign tools. I call for the (gradual) creation of a Trade Union Digital Service to amplify and co-ordinate our efforts.

### [The Monzo Reliability Report](https://monzo.com/blog/2018/07/25/monzo-reliability-report/)

I think this is all good but the following point in particular caught my eye:

> We don’t accept deviant behaviour
>
> If systems regularly misbehave in a minor way, it’s easy to fall into the trap of writing it off as ‘normal.’ We actively try to avoid thinking this way: if it’s not behaving as we designed it to, something is wrong and we make sure we understand it.

I've recently read about the "[Normalization of Deviance][normalization-of-deviance]" and realised that it's a term we could use to describe the sort of problem we often find ourselves trying to fix in code/teams we're working with. I'd like to learn more about it in the hope that it makes it easier to communicate the reason we think these things are important.

### [A pre-history of weeknotes, plus why I write them and perhaps why you should too (Week 16)](https://medium.com/job-garden/a-pre-history-of-weeknotes-plus-why-i-write-them-and-perhaps-why-you-should-too-week-16-31a4a5cbf7b0)

I think it's fair to say that we collectively struggle to write weeknotes so I enjoyed reading this and being reminded about some of the reasons we do it. [James A][james-adam] encouraged us to start writing weeknotes back in [week-138][week-138] (over 7 years ago!) and, although I don't know for sure, I'm fairly confident it was at least in part because BERG were doing the same.

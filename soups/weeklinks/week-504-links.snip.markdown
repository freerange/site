Week 504 - Interesting links
============================

### [AWS CDK Developer Preview](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-cdk-developer-preview/)

The [AWS CDK][] allows you to define infrastructure as imperative object-oriented code (e.g. JavaScript, TypeScript, Java) and provision it through [AWS CloudFormation][]. The "Abstract the Details" section says the CDK can "automatically synthesize key resources such as IAM policies, security groups, and network configuration" which sounds pretty handy!

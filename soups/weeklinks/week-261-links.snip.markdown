Wednesday Links - Week 261
==========================

We've decided to switch publication of our links to Wednesdays from now on.

### [LightPaper for Mac](http://clockworkengine.com/lightpaper-mac/)

I came across this Markdown editor over Christmas and love it. I've tried [Mou](http://mouapp.com/) (which admittedly has a slightly different purpose) in the past but never really got into the habit of using it, while I'm already using LightPaper most days. One of the things I love about LightPaper is the ability of show a tree view of a folder structure (rather than being limited to opening a single file at a time).

If you tend to write in markdown and use a Mac then it's definitely worth giving it a go. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Introducing Open Salaries at Buffer: Our Transparent Formula and All Individual Salaries](http://open.bufferapp.com/introducing-open-salaries-at-buffer-including-our-transparent-formula-and-all-individual-salaries/)

This is another one from the end of last year. I absolutely love this level of transparency at [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com/). Reading this reminds of some of the ways that I'd like to be more transparent about what we do/how we work at GFR. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [How I Launched an Email Course to 500+ People](http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/how-i-launched-an-email-course/)

I was interested enough by what Brandon had to say that I've signed up for his course on building a Ruby gem. I've only had a couple of installments so far, but I think it's quite nicely produced. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Presenters to Widgets with ActiveModel::Conversion](http://blog.carbonfive.com/2014/01/07/presenters-to-widgets-with-activemodelconversion/)

I think this trick which means you can use `render object` to render a partial corresponding to a presenter object is potentially quite useful. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [the changelog](http://thechangelog.com/)

I've signed up for their weekly email - it looks like a nice way to keep up with goings-on in the open-source world. Depending on how useful I find it, I may become a member. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [reconnecting-websocket](https://github.com/joewalnes/reconnecting-websocket)

I think this JavaScript library would've been useful on one of our internal projects a while ago - I remember a lot of grief trying to handle the flakiness of a web socket connection. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Why pair design?](http://pivotallabs.com/why-pair-design/)

I'm not sure this article sheds much light on the matter, but it's interesting that other people are doing such things. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Viewdocs](http://progrium.viewdocs.io/viewdocs)

I think this is a neat idea. Just add markdown documents to a `docs` directory in your Github repo and view them at `http://<github-username>.viewdocs.io/<repository-name>`. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [indie Phone](http://indiephone.eu/)

There's not much information to go on, but this open-source mobile phone sounds intriguing. Having said that, I've just found these [two](https://vimeo.com/81015888) [videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1QCBzQ0aNc&feature=youtu.be&t=43s) of presentations by Aral Balkan which have slightly put me off! <%= by('james-mead') %>

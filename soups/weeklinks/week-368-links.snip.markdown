Week 368 - Interesting links
============================

### [Coastermelt](http://www.misc.name/#/coastermelt/)

I was completely fascinated by this on-going series of videos by [Micah Scott][] in which she explains how she's reverse-engineering a common Blu-Ray disc recorder. The end goal is to create discs encoded with holographic images, but there have already been lots of interesting diversions along the way.

I particularly liked the way she viewed the firmware code using the [PGM image format][] in order to work out what different chunks of code might do and even what processor's instruction set they might belong to. This seems closely related to Murray's [Stegosaurus project][].

It was also fascinating to hear about some of the DRM measures present in the firmware and how she defeated them. Also her cat, [Tuco][], is incredibly cute! I can't wait for the next episode! {by james-mead}

### [PubPub - Open Publishing](http://pubpub.media.mit.edu/)

This is a (soon to be open-sourced) platform for totally transparent [academic] publishing developed by MIT. I really like it that they're encouraging publishing early and often, that review is done in the open, and that they think journals should be curators, not gatekeepers ("everyone can be a journal").

It all seems so much more sensible than the current system. I'll be interested to see how much traction it gets in academia. {by james-mead}


### [taglib-ruby](http://robinst.github.io/taglib-ruby/)

I've recently been doing a bit of work on our collaboration with [Hookline][] and I've needed to be able to read & write [ID3 tags][] to/from MP3 files. This library has worked well for me and I've found the documentation is pretty decent. {by james-mead}

### [The eagerly awaited Raspberry Pi display](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/the-eagerly-awaited-raspberry-pi-display/)

This 7" touchscreen looks great and is priced from [a very reasonable Â£52][rpi-touchscreen-prices]. I'd like to see whether I can use one for my [AIS on SDR project][ais-on-sdr] e.g. running the [OpenCPN][] chart plotter software. {by james-mead}

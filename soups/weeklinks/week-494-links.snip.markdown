Week 494 - Interesting links
============================

### [Upstream Podcast](https://www.upstreampodcast.org/workercoops1)

I enjoyed listening to this two part podcast on worker co-operatives. The first part gives an overview of what worker co-ops are and how they run and then interviews some members of various co-ops, mostly in the US, including a bicycle shop and bakery. The second part is a history of the Mondragon co-operative in the Basque region of Spain. <%= by('chris-lowis') %>

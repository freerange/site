Week 494 - Interesting links
============================

### [Upstream Podcast](https://www.upstreampodcast.org/workercoops1)

I enjoyed listening to this two part podcast on worker co-operatives. The first part gives an overview of what worker co-ops are and how they run and then interviews some members of various co-ops, mostly in the US, including a bicycle shop and bakery. The second part is a history of the Mondragon co-operative in the Basque region of Spain. <%= by('chris-lowis') %>


### [OpenPlotter](http://www.sailoog.com/openplotter)

I'm really pleased to see the continuing development of open-source software and hardware for marine leisure use. Amongst other things, this software builds on the excellent [OpenCPN][] chart plotter application and the [SignalK][] standard and specifically targets the Raspberry Pi.

It incorporates lots of other useful things, e.g. an autopilot, multiplexing of NMEA and other sensor data, a WiFi access point, etc. It's also interesting to see that the development of OpenPlotter has inspired the development of open-source hardware like the cutely named [Moitessier HAT][]. <%= by('james-mead') %>

### [Tech co-operatives are leaving the startup rat race behind](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/cotech-tech-cooperatives-blake-house-outlandish)

Our very own Chris Lowis features in this Wired article about [CoTech][co-tech]. I'm proud to be part of this growing network of organisations that are doing things a bit differently. <%= by('chris-roos') %>

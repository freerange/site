Week 320 - Interesting links
============================

### [Taking the Raspberry Pi 2 for a Test Drive with GNU Radio](http://www.rs-online.com/designspark/electronics/eng/blog/taking-the-raspberry-pi-2-for-a-test-drive-with-gnu-radio-2)

I've been playing around with [GNU Radio](http://gnuradio.org/) applications on the Raspberry Pi recently and I found this tutorial really helpful. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Rails on Docker](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/rails-on-docker)

This is a nice simple walkthrough of how to use Docker to setup a Rails development environment. Also I hadn't come across [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/), the lightweight Linux distribution, or the [headless gem](https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/headless), a Ruby wrapper around Xvfb, before. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [JRuby+Truffle - a High-Performance Truffle Backend for JRuby](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki/Truffle)

My involvement in the [London Computation Club](http://london.computation.club/) has made me more interested in the design trade-offs in compilers, interpreters, etc. This experimental implementation of an interpreter for JRuby based on the work of [an Oracle Labs intern](https://github.com/chrisseaton) sounds fascinating. Via [Tom H](http://www.thattommyhall.com/). <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [React.js Conf 2015 - Hype!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5e7kWSHWTg)

In this conference talk, Ryan Florence demonstrates some of the power of [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/). I found it all pretty impressive. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Mirage 2014 review: IPv6, TLS, Irmin, Jitsu and community growth](http://openmirage.org/blog/2014-in-review)

A conversation with [Tom S](http://codon.com/) prompted me to read some more about Mirage OS and building Unikernels. There certainly seems to be a lot of work going on in this space. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [RFC 7464, JSON Text Sequences](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2015/02/26/JSON-Text-Sequences)

Reading this reminded me of the "[ASCII Delimited Text](https://ronaldduncan.wordpress.com/2009/10/31/text-file-formats-ascii-delimited-text-not-csv-or-tab-delimited-text/)" blog post I linked to in [week 272 links](/week-272-links). The use of these ASCII control characters really appeals to me. I guess that they've not really been adopted because using printable characters is so much easier. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [xsv: Command line tool for dealing with CSV files](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv)

I spent a short while playing with this earlier today and was pretty impressed. It's not something I have a need to use everyday but I can certainly remember occasions where it would've saved me some time. Even the basic ability to display CSV data in a table will come in handy.

It also includes an option (`xsv fmt --ascii`) to convert from CSV to ASCII delimiters, as discussed in the link above. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [Little Big Details - GOV.UK info pages](http://littlebigdetails.com/post/111659257439/gov-uk-if-you-add-info-before-a-page-url-you)

I enjoy reading Little Big Details and was pleased to see them include [GOV.UK's info pages](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2014/10/29/info-pages-publishing-data-about-user-needs-and-metrics/). <%= by('chris-roos') %>

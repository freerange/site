Week 454 - Interesting links
============================

### [Creating space for the new digital economy: Space4](https://outlandish.com/blog/creating-space-for-the-new-digital-economy-space4/)

I found it really interesting to read about Outlandish's motivation behind creating the new [Space4 co-working space](http://space4.tech/) where we're renting a couple of desks.

> Outlandish found that having an office boosted our productivity and alignment and we want to support other growing co-ops to take advantage of that benefit.

We've definitely had this experience too - particularly when we had the office at 87 Worship Street. I'm really enjoying the days we spend working at Space4 and hope we find ways to spend more time there in the future. <%= by('james-mead') %>

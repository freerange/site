Week 454 - Interesting links
============================

### [Creating space for the new digital economy: Space4](https://outlandish.com/blog/creating-space-for-the-new-digital-economy-space4/)

I found it really interesting to read about Outlandish's motivation behind creating the new [Space4 co-working space](http://space4.tech/) where we're renting a couple of desks.

> Outlandish found that having an office boosted our productivity and alignment and we want to support other growing co-ops to take advantage of that benefit.

We've definitely had this experience too - particularly when we had the office at 87 Worship Street. I'm really enjoying the days we spend working at Space4 and hope we find ways to spend more time there in the future. <%= by('james-mead') %>

### [OpenSeaMap](http://www.openseamap.org/?L=1)

When I was working in Antarctica there were a lot of areas marked "unsurveyed" on the Admiralty chart around our research station and I seriously considered doing some amateur surveying in one of our little dinghies. However, with the equipment we had at the time (no GPS!) it would've been very labour intensive.

Anyway, as a result of that experience, I was irrationally excited to come across this marine version of [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/). I love the idea of lots of boats around the world [logging their depth and position](http://depth.openseamap.org/) and gradually crowd-sourcing nautical charts. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [TwiML Voice: Conference](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/conference)

We recently decided it would be good to have a company conference call phone line which we can use if we don't have decent enough connectivity for the various online conference apps which we use from time to time. To this end I've been [messing around with Twilio](https://github.com/freerange/site/blob/1a95d1463f7db558deba9baf38d079dcd67c6c2f/app/controllers/twilio/conferences_controller.rb) to set up a conference call for us to try out. I've been pleasantly surprised by how easy it's been, the quality of the documentation, and even the development & debugging functionality available. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [recutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/recutils/)

[Chris L](/chris-lowis) has previously enthused about [ledger](http://ledger-cli.org/), a command-line double-entry book-keeping system which stores data in plain text files. `recutils` is a similar idea, but for databases. I really like the general idea, particularly because it would make it possible to store one's data in version control. <%= by('james-mead') %>

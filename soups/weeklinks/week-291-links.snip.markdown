Week 291 - Interesting links
============================

### [Heroku | Introducing Heroku Button](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/8/7/heroku-button)

This looks great. It's pretty common to see software READMEs include a section on getting it installed to Heroku (e.g. my own [roosmarks][roosmarks-install] and [money-tracker][money-tracker-install]). Heroku have removed the need for quite so much documentation by allowing software authors to codify the set-up process, which should make it much easier for interested parties to get started with the software. {by chris-roos}


### [nemex.io](http://beta.nemex.io/)

> nemex is a tiny app that helps you to track and curate ideas and projects. Itâ€™s self-hosted and based on markdown.

This sounds like exactly the sort of thing I've been imagining building for a while. I'm yet to try it but the website and feature set looks great and I'm hoping it'll be just what I'm after. {by chris-roos}


### [Statlogger: Email-based stat tracking and charts](http://www.statlogger.com/)

I track a few different things on a fairly regular basis and am always thinking about how to make the process easier. While I'm not convinced that I'd use this service, I do like the simplicity of the approach: Send an email with your stat in the subject line and receive an email back with an updated chart of your data. {by chris-roos}


### [Next Bank](http://www.nextbank.org/)

This looks interesting. They appear to have quite a lot of regularly updated content from people in the banking industry that are looking to change the status quo. They also organise conferences and I notice that at [Next Bank Europe][], they're hosting the European finals of [BBVA Open Talent][]. I've not heard of the competition before but I'm aware of [BBVA][] as being the organisation that recently bought [Simple][], so it's interesting to see that they really seem to be serious about innovation in banking. {by chris-roos}

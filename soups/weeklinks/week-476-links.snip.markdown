### [Are you a senior designer?](https://medium.com/@BenHolliday/seniority-in-design-5169a39465c8)

I came across this article via [a tweet from Ben G][beng-tweet]. Like Ben I think this applies just as much to all senior positions and, despite all my years of experience (yawn!), it reminded me that there are still some important things I'm not always very good at! <%= by('james-mead') %>

### [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi)

I have some relatively fond memories of developing software using Delphi back in the late nineties. I was extremely surprised to discover that it still exists! Via [a tweet from Charles Nutter][headius-tweet]. <%= by('james-mead') %>

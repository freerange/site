Week 297 - Interesting links
============================

### [Commercial Contracts: Guarantees, commitments and risks](http://www.energizedwork.com/weblog/2014/09/commercial-contracts-guarantees-commitments-risks)

I agree with most of the sentiments in this article and I'm interested in learning more about how [Energized Work](http://www.energizedwork.com/) have put the idea of _committing to outcomes in client contracts_ into practice. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Investment rats](http://www.enlightenmenteconomics.com/blog/index.php/2014/09/investment-rats/)

I love the fact that Michael Marcovici managed to train rats to "outperform some of the world's leading human fund managers". <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Why BDD works solo, and why that matters for everyone](http://kickstartacademy.io/blog/2014-08-04-why-bdd-works-solo-and-why-that-matters-for-everyone)

I'm sure that many of the reasons I'm not keen on using [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) stem from the difficulty of developing a shared understanding of how to write and organise features and scenarios when working on a multi-person developer team. So I can definitely see why using Cucumber would be a lot less painful when working on a one-man project. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/)

Both [Chris](/chris-roos) and [Amy](https://twitter.com/amyeee) have recommended the Radiolab podcast, so although I've never really got into listening to podcasts, I plan to give it a go. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Known - Indieweb publishing platform](https://gigaom.com/2014/09/11/indieweb-advocates-launch-known-so-bloggers-can-be-social-and-still-control-their-content/)

I've been following Known's development for a while so it was good to see them announce a beta version last week. You can read more in the [blog post announcing Known][] and even listen to Known's creators on [This Week in Google 266][twig-266]. <%= by('chris-roos') %>


### [IndieWebCamp UK 2014](http://tantek.com/2014/259/b1/indiewebcampuk-hack-day-https-webactions)

Tantek has done a great job of documenting the achievements of IndieWebCamp UK. It's interesting to see how many people took the time to set-up [https][] for their websites. The use of SSL certainly seems to be gaining traction at the moment. <%= by('chris-roos') %>

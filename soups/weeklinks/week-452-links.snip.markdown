Week 452 - Interesting links
============================

### [Patterns for Decentralised Organising Workshop](https://www.eventbrite.co.nz/e/patterns-for-decentralised-organising-london-tickets-36951594213)

We're planning to attend [this workshop](https://www.eventbrite.co.nz/e/patterns-for-decentralised-organising-london-tickets-36951594213) run by Rich and Nati from [Enspiral](https://enspiral.com/). They contribute to [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/) a software tool for decision making in decentralised organisations. We've been using Loomio within [CoTech](https://www.coops.tech/) and are really keen to learn more about scaling the kind of decision making we use at Go Free Range to larger, more distributed organisations. <%= by('chris-lowis') %>


### [ATM fees abroad: Asking the Monzo Community to decide pricing](https://monzo.com/blog/2017/09/13/atm-fees-abroad/)

When we were exploring the [possibility of setting up a Credit Union](/credit-union), one of the points in [our manifesto](https://github.com/freerange/bank/wiki#manifesto) was:

> Operate a banking entity transparently and for the benefit of its members

So I'm really pleased to see Monzo being so transparent - they explain the underlying costs and suggest three possible solutions all of which aim to be non-profit-making, easy to understand, and fair. Apparently most of the underlying costs are incurred by a small percentage of their users. I can imagine that percentage might be quite vocal, but hopefully Monzo will come to a decision that's fair for everyone. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [Space 4: A co-working and events space in the heart of Finsbury Park](http://space4.tech/)

Recently we (particularly [Chris L](/chris-lowis)) have been helping Polly from [Outlandish](https://outlandish.com/) put together this simple website for the co-working space. We've been enjoying working there 1-2 days a week and getting to know the other members. I think most of the co-working desks are now taken, but if you're interested in hiring a meeting room or an events room, do [get in touch with Polly](mailto:polly@outlandish.com). <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [House Address "Twins" Proximity](http://www.paulplowman.com/stuff/house-address-twins-proximity/)

This account of finding the the shortest distance between two houses with the same number and street name made me laugh and is well worth a read. <%= by('james-mead') %>

============================

### [Patterns for Decentralised Organising Workshop](https://www.eventbrite.co.nz/e/patterns-for-decentralised-organising-london-tickets-36951594213)

We're planning to attend [this workshop](https://www.eventbrite.co.nz/e/patterns-for-decentralised-organising-london-tickets-36951594213) run by Rich and Nati from [Enspiral](https://enspiral.com/). They contribute to [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/) a software tool for decision making in decentralised organisations. We've been using Loomio within [CoTech](https://www.coops.tech/) and are really keen to learn more about scaling the kind of decision making we use at Go Free Range to larger, more distributed organisations. <%= by('chris-lowis) %>

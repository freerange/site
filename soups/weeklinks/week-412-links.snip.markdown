Week 412 - Interesting links
============================

### [The Cooperative Technologists have landed](http://outlandish.com/blog/the-cooperative-technologists-have-landed/)

Thanks to [Ellie][] of [Outlandish][] for writing up a bit about the conference that we attended a few weeks back. Thanks also to Tancredi of [Agile Collective][] who's also written [this more detailed post][agile-coop-writeup]. The wiki elves have also been busy and [write-ups for many of the sessions][cotech-wiki] are now available. <%= by('james-mead') %>

### [Raspberry Pi Camera Web Interface](http://elinux.org/RPi-Cam-Web-Interface)

I've recently used this on a personal project where I wanted to stream video from a Raspberry Pi camera module over the interwebs. Although it's not as flashy as some other similar projects I found it more straightforward to install and it seems very solid so far. <%= by('james-mead') %>


### [One-Click Coop](http://create.oneclick.uk.coop/coops/intro)

I was quite surprised to come across this online process for creating a co-op. I'm curious to know how much flexibility it allows in choosing an appropriate legal entity, governing documents, etc. I also wonder how much of the process is automated. Via [Tom Stuart][]. <%= by('james-mead') %>

### [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/)

Microsoft is offering free [Jupyter Notebook][jupyter] hosting with support for R and Python. I played around with a Jupyter Notebook with the [IRuby kernel][iruby] a while ago and demonstrated it at [Show & Tell 23][jupyteriruby]. It's encouraging to see the project getting some more traction and, although its Microsoft, the [FAQ says][azure-faq]: "Currently the service itself is free. This may change in the future, but we hope to always have a free tier available". <%= by('james-mead') %>

### [how_is](https://github.com/how-is/how_is)

I came across this tool in the [Ruby Together progress report for December][]. Apparently the plan is to use it to actively [appraise the status][example-how-is-report] of their projects. I'm not sure about everything they've included in the report, but I definitely like the idea - it's the kind of thing I've done manually a lot in the past when deciding what gem to use on a project. From that perspective, it'd be great if it also included stats about tests. <%= by('james-mead') %>

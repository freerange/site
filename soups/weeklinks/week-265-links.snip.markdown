Week 265 - Interesting links
============================

### [Every line of code is always documented](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2014/02/hidden-documentation/)

This is roughly in line with the themes discussed at [TICOSA](http://ticosa.org/). The author gives some useful git tips to help with digging into the story of the code, as well some general tips to help you be nice to your future self and colleagues. <%= by('chris-roos') %>

### [Sublime Text plugin to show the git commit history for one or more lines of code](https://github.com/cbumgard/GitCommitMsg)

I haven't tried this but it looks like it could be useful shortcut for finding the commit history for a specific line of code. The author says they were inspired by the [Every line of code is always documented](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2014/02/hidden-documentation/) post. <%= by('chris-roos') %>

### [The git pickaxe](http://www.philandstuff.com/2014/02/09/git-pickaxe.html)

Following on from Chris' links above, this article by Phil Potter is a good explanation of how to use git to do software archeology. This relates quite closely to [something I'm currently working on](https://github.com/freerange/method_log). <%= by('james-mead') %>

### [rel="source"](http://adactio.com/journal/6667/)

This reminded me of a thought I'd had about linking web pages (e.g. blog posts or news articles) to their source in version control (assuming that's how they're stored). I can imagine that such a machine readable link would make it possible to add something to the browser to give a nice view of the history of the page over time. <%= by('chris-roos') %>

### [Choosing an OSS license doesn't need to be scary](http://choosealicense.com/)

This was one of a number of useful links from [Despo Pentara](https://twitter.com/despo)'s recent LRUG Lightning Talk on [how to get started with Open Source](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5057-open-source-how-to-get-started).

### [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines)

This was another good tip from Despo's talk. I'd read about it before, but failed to do anything about it - so this was a good reminder to split out the [contributing instructions for Mocha](https://github.com/freerange/mocha/commit/7095aaad20d283ca4b710aa534a397c2136dfe12). <%= by('james-mead') %>

### [How many S-expression formats are there for Ruby?](http://www.matijs.net/blog/2012/11/04/how-many-s-expression-formats-are-there-for-ruby)

I've spent quite a bit of the last week researching various Ruby parsers for converting Ruby code into an AST of S-expressions. Libraries in this space appear to have gone off in a few different directions, so I was interested to read about Unified Ruby. <%= by('james-mead') %>

### [Background Work and Leadership](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/background-work-and-leadership/712114115488122)

> Someone who habitually digs deeper than strictly necessary is worth listening to.  When they know, they will say so.  When they don't know, they'll say so and then, if they are curious, go do the work to find out.

I like to think this is at the heart of the way we operate at [GFR](/). <%= by('james-mead') %>

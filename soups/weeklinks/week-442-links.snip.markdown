Week 442 - Interesting links
============================

### [Open API Standards for UK Banking](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/)

I was interested to read of the release of v1.0.0 of [Open Banking Read/Write API specifications][open-banking-api]. I assume this is the result of the [Competition & Markets Authority's report into retail banking][cma-open-banking]. At first glance this looks promising, although it's not obvious how soon we're going to see any implementations. {by james-mead}

### [Refactoring - Not on the backlog!](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/refactoring-not-on-the-backlog/)

I think this old article contains a good explanation of why it's better to embed refactoring into your day-to-day development, rather than rely on scheduling time explicitly for refactoring. {by james-mead}


### [Child benefit tax calculator is missing pre-tax pension contribution field](https://github.com/alphagov/calculators/pull/173)

I was fascinated to see this pull request by [Matthew Somerville][] in which he highlights some confusion in the [Child benefit tax calculator on GOV.UK][child-benefit-tax-calculator]. On the one hand, it's great that the source code is open allowing Matthew to read the code to understand the calculations; on the other hand, it's a real shame that he can't interact more directly with the subject matter expert in the relevant department. Matthew also legitimately suggests that GOV.UK do some user testing on this application. {by james-mead}

### [Cooling the tube â€“ Engineering heat out of the Underground](https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/blog/2017/06/10/cooling-the-tube-engineering-heat-out-of-the-underground/)

This is a brilliantly detailed look at why it's so hard to keep the London Underground cool and how the problems might be solved. {by james-mead}


### [ticketclever](https://www.ticketclever.com/)

A new train journey planning website helping make sense of the ridiculously complicated UK rail network ticket pricing. {by james-mead}


### [How to Create a MOOC in 28 Days](https://www.indiehackers.com/@sknthla/how-to-create-a-mooc-in-28-days)

We've occasionally talked about writing on-line courses to generate an alternative revenue stream, so I was interested to read this article about creating a MOOC on the [teachable platform][]. {by james-mead}

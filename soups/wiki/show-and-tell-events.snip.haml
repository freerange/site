%h2#show-and-tell-events Show and Tell Events

%p We host this event on the second Wednesday of every month. The idea is for people to demonstrate side projects, open-source projects, etc in an informal setting with the aim of garnering friendly and constructive feedback.

      Subscribing to the Google Group will automatically invite you to a recurring calendar event for the Show & Tell. Please ignore the location of the first calendar event email you receive as it's our old office address. The actual location will be updated closer to the event (i.e. when we've found somewhere to host it!)

%h2#show-and-tell-events Show and Tell Events

%p We host this event on the second Wednesday of every month, starting at 6.30pm and running for two hours. The idea is for people to demonstrate side projects, open-source projects, etc in an informal setting with the aim of garnering friendly and constructive feedback.

%h3#meeting-format Meeting format

%p You don't need to have something to demo in order to participate. So if you're interested please do come along - your constructive feedback on other people's projects will always be welcome. Demos don't have to be technical in nature, although they should probably be aimed at a relatively technical audience. Reading the notes on previous meetings (see links below) will give you an indication of the types of projects that people have demoed in the past.

%p The meeting is always very informal. Depending on how many people have things to show, you will typically have up to about 20 mins to demo your thing. We aim to hold meetings in a room with wi-fi and a projector or large screen, usually connected to an Apple TV and/or Chromecast. Let us know in advance if you have specific requirements and we'll do our best to accommodate you.

%p The meeting usually lasts about 2 hours, but, for those who can spare the time, we usually decamp to a nearby hostelry for post-meeting refreshment. This is a chance to continue interesting discussions initiated during the meeting.

%p If you have any questions, please <a href='mailto:lets@gofreerange.com'>get in touch</a>.

Project Credit Union - Day 2
============================

Continued to investigate some of the ways in which we can transfer money in/out of a credit union account. Faster Payments, BACS, CHAPS, Direct debit.

I've applied for a London Capital Credit Union account.

James has applied for a London Community Credit Union account.

Pointed out a possible error with passport validation in the London Community Credit Union application process.

They both have online banking but only the London Community Credit Union has a current account too.

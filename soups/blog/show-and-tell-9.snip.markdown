Show and Tell 9
---------------

We hosted our 9th Show and Tell on Wednesday last week.

We considered postponing until we have a new space of our own but decided that keeping up the rhythm was more important. [James][] did a great job of scouting potential venues and we eventually settled on [The Studio at The Star of Kings](http://starofkings.co.uk/private-hire/). It was perfectly big enough for the eight of us and the wall mounted TV allowed us to connect our laptops and share things from our screens.

[Tom S][] kicked off by talking about a few things he's working at the moment. The first is his [How to Write a Web Application in Ruby][] ebook. He talked us through his custom workflow involving [DocBook][] and [Apache FOP][] to generate a good looking PDF. Tom went on to talk about an ongoing project to help explain [Lambda calculus][] in a web page. He demonstrated a very early version of this to us back in [week 268][] and then again during [Show and Tell 8][] when he'd rewritten his hand-rolled JavaScript to use [Backbone.js][]. He's now started exploring using [React][] and has been really impressed with the resulting code and behaviour. There's still more to do to bring it into line with the Backbone version but it looks interesting so far. Tom finished up by demonstrating a simple project to redirect broken [Rubyforge][] links. Rubyforge was shut down a while ago leaving an awful lot of links going nowhere. Tom's created [rubyforge-redirects][] - a simple web app currently hosted on Heroku - to redirect <project>.rubyforge.org URLs to somewhere sensible. Tom [tweeted about it on Thursday][] and wants help building out the set of redirects. If you've been frustrated by following a link to rubyforge.org and found yourself at a 404 then consider helping out!

After a little food and drink break, [Nicky][] took up the presenter role and gave us a preview of the talk she gave at the [February Ember London meetup][] the following night. Nicky talked us through the process of evolving the "Like" button on [FutureLearn][] to make it more accessible. It was interesting to learn about the techniques used and I hope it served as a useful dry-run before the main event the following evening. Nicky's [written this up in more detail on the FutureLearn blog][fl-blog-post-accessible-like] and it looks like [Ember London][] make videos of the talks available online so you should be able to see the talk soon.

[Chris L][] finished off the evening by talking us through some of the features of the [Web Audio Editor in Firefox][], the [Google I/O 2015 Web Audio demo][] and an idea he has for a book based around [Web Audio][]. The subject of the book sounds really interesting to me and I'd certainly like to encourage Chris to work on it.

We had a good follow-up discussion around delivering content in book form versus something else. Tom talked about some of the difficulties of formatting code in his books and mentioned the decision for [Two Scoops of Django 1.6][] to drop their ebook formats. I was surprised by the comment about Two Scoops of Django until learning quite how much work goes into ensuring it works on the many e-reading devices out there. I find it strange that we've got a great way to display this content (html) but that we try to convert it to many other formats, presumably to make it more "book" like and to increase the change of someone reading it. [Amy][] mentioned that the initial feedback to their [Minimum Viable Book][] was that the video snippets worked really well. Video obviously doesn't work in print and the plan is for the next version to be printed on newspaper so it'll be interesting to see what feedback comes next.

I really enjoyed it and I'm glad we decided to keep it up despite not having a space of our own.

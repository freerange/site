You pay for an NDA
===================


At {gfr} we try and simplify as much as we can, from the structure of our company to the software we build, and a part of that is the process of agreeing to work with a new client.

Quite often we are approached by clients with only a vague outline of their project, and before we can find out more, they ask us to sign a [non-disclosure agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement), or **NDA**.

The purpose of the NDA is to provide *Party A*, who has some information they feel is valuable (typically an idea or strategy), from any negative consequences of sharing that information with *Party B*. So, if *Party A* has an idea for how to build a better widget, they can talk about it with *Party B* without fear that *Party B* will just take the idea and build it themselves. In theory.


A can of worms
----

Now this all seems reasonable on the surface -- I don't want to share some amazing insight with you only for you to turn it into a business before I get the chance -- but the problem is that they're frequently written in fairly arcane legalise, and *almost always* amiguous in scope.

If we signed your NDA, are we making ourselves vulnerable to future prosecution if it seems like we might be working on something similar in the future? If another client approaches us with an idea, are we going to feel compelled to turn them away in case one of our previous NDAs covers some ideas that are superficially similar? Who decides whether or not we've used information from a client, or whether or not we had that idea ourselves? Who watches the watchmen?!


It's all about trust
------

We believe that trust is a vital part of the process of [building software in an agile way](http://agilemanifesto.org/ '"Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"'), and that trust extends through all aspects of our relationship with a client, and that client's relationship with us. That's why we try and meet with everyone who gets in touch and offer them our perspective on their project, even if we know that we're going to take them on as a client.

By sharing our insights about your idea, and approaches that might help you realise that idea, we're trying to establish trust. But if you (the client) want us to enter a legal agreement before we can even start that process, then we're going to consider that meeting **billable**.

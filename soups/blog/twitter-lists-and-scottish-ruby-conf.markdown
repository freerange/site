A Twitter list of Scottish Ruby Conf's speakers and attendees. Also, a little help required.
====

tl;dr. If you're going to [Scottish Ruby Conf][] (or even if you're not) we'd love you to subscribe to our Twitter lists of [attendees][] and/or [speakers][] and let us know whether they're a useful way of observing the conference (by [email][] or on [twitter][]).

Tom mentioned the little [Lanyrd][] + Twitter list idea we've been playing with in his [notes for week 179][]. It's named [heylist][] and is tasked with generating [Twitter Lists][] of conference speakers and attendees. If you look at [Hey List's lists][] then you'll see that we've generated them for a couple of previous conferences and one upcoming conference; namely [Scottish Ruby Conf][]. We've generated a list of all [attendees][] and [speakers][].

We have a feeling that subscribing to these lists would be a good way to get a feel for what's happening at, and around, the conference. There are obviously other ways of achieving something similar (by following [#scotruby][], for example) but our feeling is that the Twitter list will give you the most comprehensive view of what's going on.

Heylist itself is just a script that's, currently, hardcoded to download the Scottish Ruby Conf attendees, and speakers, from Lanyrd and pop them up into a Twitter list. We'd love your help to decide whether to develop it into something more. So, if you're attending Scottish Ruby Conf, or just want to watch from the sidelines, it'd be great if you could subscribe to our list of [attendees][] and/or [speakers][] and let us know how useful they are (by [email][] or on [twitter][]).

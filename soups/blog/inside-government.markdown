Inside Government
=================

Yesterday [Paul took the wraps off][paul-password-removal] the new [Inside Government section][govuk-inside-government] of [gov.uk][govuk]. This is the project we've been working on with the [Government Digital Service][gds] since back in [Week 140][week-140]. While we've been [continously delivering][continuous-deployment] the application to a restricted set of users since the early days of the project, we're really pleased it's now accessible to the public.

[Neil][neil-williams] has eloquently explained [what we've built][neil-blog-post-2] and [why it matters][neil-blog-post-1]. While the [citizen-facing part of gov.uk][govuk-beta-first-release] was focussed on "serving the needs of the mainstream majority", [Inside Government][govuk-inside-government] is about "meeting the needs of the engaged minority" i.e. those that need to know what government is doing - perhaps because it's part of their job or just a personal interest.

The idea is that it should become the best place to find out how government works, see what it's doing and get involved. It should keep you up-to-date with the UK government's [news][government-news], [policies][government-policies], [publications][government-publications], etc. Hopefully it'll make it easier to [read about][government-consultations] and contribute to government thinking before it becomes policy. You can also find information about [government ministers][government-ministers], [departments and organisations][government-departments] and the UK's interests and policies in the [rest of the world][government-world].

One nice touch is the short links to government departments e.g. [www.gov.uk/fco][government-fco], [www.gov.uk/mod][government-mod], [www.gov.uk/hmrc][government-hmrc] .

There's a lot more work to do, but we're confident that [GDS][gds] will [listen to users' feedback][government-feedback] and continue to [release early and release often][release-early-release-often]. So why not take the [site for spin][govuk-inside-government].

Thanks to [Neil][neil-williams], [Pete][pete-herlihy] and [all our comrades at GDS][whitehall-contributors].

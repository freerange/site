Rubyforge redirects
-------------------

[Rubyforge redirects](https://github.com/tomstuart/rubyforge-redirects)

Rubyforge was [shutdown about 4 years ago][rubyforge-shutdown], which led to [Tom Stuart][] starting this project. Sometime later, [Ruby Central][] were persuaded to setup redirects for some of the projects whose documentation used to live on rubyforge.org.

Many blog posts and even gem pages still link to rubyforge.org URLs, e.g. the "Documentation" link on the [Rack gem page][rack-gem]. So I was disappointed to [notice][copeland-tweet] the other day that these redirects seem to have disappeared. Indeed, although Ruby Central still seem to own the domain, the domain isn't responding to HTTP traffic at all.

I've tried contacting Ruby Central folk via Twitter and [email][ruby-central-email] to see whether they'd be open to the idea of a community-led project (like Tom's) taking over the domain to keep these URLs alive, but I haven't had any reply.

As Tim Berners-Lee said: [Cool URIs don't change][cool-uris]. And as Tom wrote, it would be a [waste][tom-why] if all rubyforge.org URLs died.

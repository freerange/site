Upcoming availability
=====================

We have some availability coming up. Here's a few ways we might be able to help you:

- We're a team of 4 [experienced developers](http://gofreerange.com#people). We're happy [building new applications from scratch](http://gofreerange.com/projects#harmonia) or [refactoring legacy code](http://gofreerange.com/projects#smart-answers).
- We enjoy working with existing teams and particularly coaching new developers. You might want to [build a team around us](http://gofreerange.com/projects#futurelearn-mooc-platform) while we help you to establish good development practices.
- We prefer to work in an agile way. We can show you how that works and work with you to adopt agile practices.
- Give us a problem to solve - we love [creative projects](http://gofreerange.com/projects) and prototyping.

Our favourite language is Ruby and we're happy to work on Rails projects. We can also turn our hand to JavaScript and iOS development. We've worked on web applications, data-processing systems, 3D graphics, voice-controlled applications including the Alexa, video- and audio-processing tools, data science and more. We love a challenge.

If you think we might be able to work together [drop us a line](mailto:lets@gofreerange.com) and we'll arrange to meet you for a cuppa.

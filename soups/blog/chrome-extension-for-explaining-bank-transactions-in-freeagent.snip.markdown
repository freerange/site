Chrome extension for explaining bank transactions in FreeAgent
=======

As regular readers of this blog will know, we're very keen on automating away as many mundane administrative tasks as we can. A few months back, [Chris][] described how he'd [created a bookmarklet][] to help with our weekly [Harmonia][] task to upload and explain our bank transactions within [FreeAgent][], our excellent book-keeping software.

As we added more and more rules to the bookmarklet it became more and more useful. We got to the point where we thought it might be useful to other people and so we decided to make it a bit more generic. We also wanted to make it easy for people to install and configure. To this end, we decided to have a go at converting the bookmarklet into a [Chrome extension][].

We have a few [bookmarklets][] and [userscripts][] which we use internally and we thought it would be useful to know more about how to create Chrome extensions. Also we want to get better at _building things_ and writing about them, and this seemed like a good candidate.

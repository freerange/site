Project Credit Union - Day 10
=============================

I'm afraid there's very little to report on from yesterday.

James and I had a good chat with a chap who's also thinking about some of the interesting possibilities in the credit union space. It's all very early stage stuff and we've agreed not to say any more about it at the moment.

It's possible that there'll be a few more short updates this week as James is taking the rest of the week off and I'm away on Friday.

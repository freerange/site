Project Credit Union - Day 1
============================

## Intro

We're going to see whether we can start a [credit union][]. We've been talking about this for a while and we've decided to use our current break from client work to see if there's anything in the idea.

We started in earnest yesterday, Tuesday 24th June. We have no real idea how feasible this is but we figured that the best way to discover that was to start the process. We're going to document our progress on this blog.

Even if we don't end up with a credit union, we'll hopefully learn a few things on the way.

## Day 1

### Our motivation

[James][] and I spent some time discussing our motivation for creating a credit union. There are a few different things that we're interested in exploring:

* Building a good banking website.
* Creating a transparent bank-like organisation.
* Potentially being able to offer banking services to small technology businesses that are just getting off the ground.

We discussed building an alternative interface to an existing banking website, and even building something entirely separate that streamlined the process of getting transaction data from bank websites. We also considered partnering with an existing credit union to see if we could help with their current online banking offering.

Ultimately, we felt that we'd only really be able to demonstrate the functionality that we think should exist by controlling the the financial product too. To that end, we decided to focus on testing the feasibility of creating our own credit union.

### ABCUL and our minimum viable credit union

James had already been in touch with [ABCUL][] (Association of British Credit Unions Limited) and they'd sent us over some information. Not put off by what we'd read, we set out to list our minimum viable credit union. Here's what we think we'd like to start with:

* Electronic transfer in and out of your account
* No loans
* No debit cards
* No credit cards
* No interest on savings

We've contacted ABCUL again to ask whether it's even worth considering what we're trying to do. If they don't think that what we're trying to do is crazy then the next step appears to be to register as a study group so that we can use their knowledge to help us apply to become a credit union.

### Existing credit unions

We searched a list of [London credit unions][] to see if there was anyone trying to do something similar. Of the 19 results there are 3 that both James and I appear to be able to join based on a common geographical bond.

One that stuck out was [Group London][] that appears to have some crossover with what we're thinking about. It doens't look like they've actually started yet so we've contacted them to ask if they're still proceeding with creating a credit union.

### The credit union application form

We finished the day by going through the Credit Union Application form from the [Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority site][BoE PRA]. It's a pretty lengthy form and contains lots of questions that we don't have immediate answers to. It also states that they "are required by law to determine applications within the earlier of (a) six months of receipt of a completed application or (b) twelve months of receiving an incomplete application."

There are lots of reasons why this project might not succeed but it feels good to be working on something tangible, something that's not just software and something that could eventually help other people.

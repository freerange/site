Who is Harmonia For?
===============

There are lots of aspects of [Harmonia][] that we want to explore in more detail, like how to create smart recurring tasks, and what makes a good task, but before that we'd like to spend a bit of time exploring who might find Harmonia useful. If you're a part of anything like:

* [Small companies](#for-companies)
* [Project teams](#for-project-teams)
* [Other teams](#other-teams)
* [Groups who don't normally identify as a 'team'](#even-if-you-dont-think-youre-in-a-team)

... then we think you might find our little app useful.


## Teams, groups and tasks

If you're a regular reader of this blog, you've probably heard quite a bit about Harmonia already, and in particular how we use it at [Free Range][]. You probably have a good idea about how we use to assign things like invoicing or weeknotes.

However, not everyone works in exactly the same company as we do, and so it might not be immediately obvious how Harmonia might work for them. I think it's true to say that our tool won't necessarily work in *every* organisation, but we believe that it can work in more places than you might first think.

We might not realise it, but more often than not we find ourselves in teams or groups. The group could be your whole company, or just the colleagues within your part of a company, or less obvious groups like families, flatmates, or even sports teams.

Wherever you work, whatever you do, almost every team or group of people has something in common: **a collection of tasks or chores that all need to happen on various regular schedules**.

### Success comes from clarity of responsibility

Quite often those tasks are peripheral to the purpose of the group (building software and helping clients in our case, or playing sports in the case of a local football team, for example).

In most cases, for any of those tasks or chores: **it doesn't really matter *who* does it, but it is important that it *does get done***. Most of the time, if a chore in a team doesn't get done, it's because nobody decided to take on the responsibility of doing it.

This is what [Harmonia][] does -- it helps ensure that those things actually get done. It achieves this by **automatically managing who is responsible** for achieving those things, and sharing who is assigned with everyone in the team.

That's the secret of Harmonia. It's not for planning projects or dictating workflows, it's just about getting the boring stuff done so you can focus on the more interesting parts of your day.

Let's take a look at some concrete examples of Harmonia working for different kinds of teams.


## For companies

Since we are all co-owners of [our company][Free Range], we're all explicitly responsible for all of the business operations as well as the actual work of producing software. We rely on Harmonia to help our company run smoothly.

To give you a better sense of what that actually means, here's a screenshot of our team in Harmonia right now:

Even if you're just working with a business partner in a team of two, you'll share very similar responsibilities to ours. By removing the question *"shall I start doing X, or is my partner going to do it?"*, Harmonia can help you get the day-to-day chores out of the way, and focus on the far more important work of building your business.

## Project teams

Harmonia is not just about running a company, paying VAT and filing annual returns.

Even if your whole company doesn't work quite like [Free Range][], we think you could still find it useful. Here's an example team that's working inside a larger company, and using Harmonia to take care of some of shared office chores:

![Example Harmonia tasks for a project team within a company](/images/blog/harmonia-project-team.png "Project Team Alpha working within OmniCorp to make the babyfood that Robocop eats.")

Every task can have an easy-to-follow detailed description, so that you don't try and remember how to do everything:

![An example description of the TPS Reports task for Project Team Alpha](/images/blog/harmonia-tps-reports.png "We're going to need you to come in on Saturday. Ok? Great.")

We find that a set of clear, repeatable steps makes tasks much easier -- and *faster* -- to achieve.

## Other teams

It's not even just about business and companies -- every group can benefit from sharing tasks and chores. Here's how an amateur sports club might use Harmonia to keep things running smoothly:

![Example Harmonia tasks for a football team](/images/blog/harmonia-rovers.png "Ball, ball ball... footie, footie, footie... Ball, ball, ball... Football!")


## Even if you don't think you're in a 'team'

Some groups of people aren't obviously 'teams' -- like flatmates, for example. Shared households work more smoothly if everyone's responsibilities are clear and visible, so why not use Harmonia for that too?

![Example Harmonia tasks for some flatmates](/images/blog/harmonia-our-house.png "Andy never rememberd to do the cleaning, but with Harmonia he gets an email reminder")

A few families or flat-shares might use a rota to share these things out, and that's not a *bad* system, but who maintains the rota? With Harmonia, there's no need to update it every few weeks or months. Harmonia just keeps on working.


## Try it out!

Hopefully these examples have given you some ideas about how you might be able to use [Harmonia][] in your team or group. We are really excited to explore how our philosophy of shared responsibility might help lots of different types of organisations work together in a smoother, more *harmonius* way.

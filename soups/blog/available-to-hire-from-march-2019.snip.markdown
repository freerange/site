Available to hire from March 2019
=================================

We're available to hire from this month and are on the lookout for our next project. Here's a few ways we might be able to help you:

- We're a team of 4 [experienced developers](/#people) who are as comfortable [building new applications from scratch](/projects#crown-marketplace) as we are [refactoring legacy code](/projects#trainline).

- We'll get your application deployed to a PaaS (e.g. Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk), to IaaS (e.g. AWS EC2, Linode) or to your own servers.

- We enjoy working with existing teams and particularly coaching new developers. You might want to [build a team around us](/projects#futurelearn-mooc-platform) while we help you to establish good development practices.

- We can improve developer productivity by encouraging effective git workflows, configuring Vagrant for repeatable development environments, offering advice about testing strategies and promoting the use of CI.

- We prefer to work in an agile way. We can show you how that works and work with you to adopt agile practices.

- Give us a problem to solve - we love [creative projects](/projects) and prototyping.

Our favourite language is Ruby and we're happy to work on Rails projects. We can also turn our hand to [JavaScript](/projects#bbc-voice), [Elm](/projects#mission-patch) and iOS development. We've worked on web applications, data-processing systems, 3D graphics, voice-controlled applications including the Alexa, video- and audio-processing tools, data science and more. We love a challenge.

[In 2018][gfr-2018] we worked for [GDS][gds] (consolidating multiple asset manager apps), [BBC R&D][bbc-rd] (making it easier to create interactive stories for Amazon Alexa), [Business & Human Rights Resource Centre][bhrrc] (reducing hosting costs by migrating from Heroku to AWS), [Trainline][trainline] (helping merge codebases), [CCS][ccs] (building prototype of the Crown Marketplace) and [Raising IT][raising-it] (training).

If you think we might be able to work together [drop us a line](mailto:lets@gofreerange.com) and we'll arrange to meet you for a cuppa.

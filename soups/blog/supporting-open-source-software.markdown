Supporting open-source software
=======

All of us at Go Free Range know that our careers and even the existence of the co-operative itself owe a lot to [open-source software] and the community around it. In particular we've made extensive use of the [Ruby] programming language, the [Ruby on Rails] web framework, library hosting by [Rubygems], and the [Bundler] package manager in many of our client and internal projects.

Over the years members of [GFR] have authored a number of open-source projects, e.g. [rails engines], [printer], [recap], [edge-redirector] and [mocha]. We also always try to support the open-source community as much as possible by reporting issues and submitting pull requests. And we try to [work in the open][freerange-site] as much as possible and encourage [our clients to do the same][alphagov-whitehall].

I want to give my colleagues and GFR a big shout-out for being hugely supportive of my work on [mocha], the Ruby mocking library that I authored way back in 2006. At times, like many open-source maintainers, I've found this to be an onerous and thankless task. However, since mocha was used in Rails itself for many years and is still used in plenty of [long-lived codebases][shopify-engineering], I still feel quite a responsibility to maintain it. I don't think I would've managed to keep working on it without the support from GFR.

Recently we've been reflecting on the debt we owe to the open-source community and investigating ways we could recognise this. However, it turns out it's quite hard to work out how to do it effectively. In [this article][sentry-oss-donations] Chad Whitacre explains the difficulties Sentry had in donating a serious chunk of money to open-source projects. While projects like [thanks.dev] & [StackAid] are doing pioneering work in this area, they're not really useful to us, because we're not (yet!) a product company.

Anyway, after much deliberation, we've all decided to join [Ruby Together] as [Developer members][rubytogether-plans] making regular monthly payments to support their valuable work on Rubygems, Bundler, etc. We see this as just the next step in an ongoing journey to increase our support and appreciation of the world of open-source software.

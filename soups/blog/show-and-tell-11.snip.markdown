Show and Tell 11
----------------

We hosted our 11th Show and Tell in our shiny new office in Shoreditch Works.

We managed to seat 8 of us and project on to the blank wall opposite the windows. It was a bit tight but not too disimilar to the space we used in our old office.

## Foodgeeks and Bummy Tummy

Ryan started proceedings by talking about two projects he's currently working on. The first is a food journaling app that hopes to surface patterns between what you've consumed and how you're feeling. Similar to MyFitnessPal but with a hopefully much more friendly user interface. The second project is a refresh of Food Geeks - a site he's run for the best part of 15 years now.

Wants to get enough recipes to make it possible to aggregate recipe data.

## Personal data collection

I demonstrated a very simple JavaScript app I put together to pull data from a number of different spreadsheets and show them all on one page for a given date. I wondered whether that would help me see something in the data I'd been collecting but that turns out not to really be the case.

Data I'm collecting:

places visited
film and tv
weight
standing desk
reading diary
oyster journey history
barclays cycle hire

## AIS on SDR

James had put together a little presentation to give people an overview of his plans for the AIS on SDR project. He explained the problems faced by small boats crossing some of the busier shipping lanes, the relative expense of commercial AIS devices and how he's planning to build a low-cost alternative with a USB TV Tuner and Raspberry Pi.

## Timelapse with a Raspberry Pi

Ben talked us through the building of his Raspberry Pi Timelapse device. It was great hearing how it evolved from a silent camera in the corner, to something with a screen, to something that played a tune when it was about to take a picture. This change alone resulted in the family photobombing the image captures :-)

## A Tiny Letter Blog and Dokku

Paul explained how we'd created a simple blog from some Tiny Letter archives - http://other-valleys.herokuapp.com/

Standard Postgresql full text search is really good.

Dokku's a really good alternative to Heroku. Apps on the Heroku free plan are already problematic due to the start-up time (e.g. Paul's phone app) but they're potentially going to get worse with Heroku's new pricing plan (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9295874).

Kalv Goes West
=============

It's been quiet here on the blog, which means that we're busy, for better or for worse. Regardless, it would be remiss not to take note of a small amount of shuffling on the deck of the Good Ship {fr}.

Our colleague and friend {link_to kalvir-sandhu,Kalv} is leaving us. In September he'll be emigrating to the fresh, untilled soils of British Columbia. 

Kalv has been a key member of our company right from the start. We're going to miss his business acumen and his drive & determination. His user-driven focus has been invaluable in a company composed entirely of technical people. We've learned a lot from him, and our loss is now Canada's gain.

We're sad to see him go, but it's going to be the start of a great adventure for Kalv and his family; we can't wait to hear all [aboot][] it.

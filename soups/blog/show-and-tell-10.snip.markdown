I started by explaining how I use Google Forms and Todoist to keep records of some personal data I want to collect.

I asked whether anyone else collects this sort of information. Tom S collects some health information but does so automatically using a fitbit and scales.

Murray collects quite a lot of this information with the intention of doing something with it, but has never quite got that far. This is the same as me.

Interesting discussion about big data in health and whether it causes more problems.

Interesting discussion of money tracking - Nicky and Tom have started using YNAB, which I've also recently been investigating.

I gave a little demonstration of xsv having included it in our week links from yesterday.

Ben was up next and showed some pictures of some of the games and game accesories he's been making with his children. He's making a board game with his son and explained how he's been trying to model the rules to see how long the game will take and to try to ensure a fair game.

Apparently there's quite a market in handmade inserts for board game boxes, with lots of manufacturers simply supplying the pieces lose in the box.

Tom S showed [@revdancatt's "kindle book cataloging system"](https://twitter.com/revdancatt/status/572837279535915009/photo/1).

Tom S finished up by talking us through some more of his book publishing workflow. He's taken a ruby script that was shelling out to Pygmentize and re-written it in Python so that he can dig deeper into the lifecycle and get more control over the output.

I was a little worried as it wasn't obvious than anyone was going to show anything but I think it worked out OK in the end.

Show & Tell no more
===================

Sad news, folks: we've decided to stop hosting our [Show & Tell events][show-and-tell-events].

It feels as though external interest has been waning a bit and that, combined with our personal commitments, means we've been struggling to motivate ourselves to host and attend in recent months.

We're really grateful to everyone that's joined us at any of the 50ish events we've hosted over the past 5 years. Whether you shared your many and varied projects with us or joined us to learn from others (as I most often did) you made the event what it was. Thank you. You're all excellent.

We haven't ruled out hosting similar events in future and we'd love to hear from you if you have an idea for an event we might be able to help with.

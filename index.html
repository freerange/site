        <h1>How we work?</h1>

        <h2>Software is alive</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>it's not a static artefact, so it can't be described by a static spec or plan</li>
          <li>it needs to grow and evolve according to its environment, to best suit the needs of its users. These needs change over time, even as the software is being built.</li>
          <li>the best way to do this is to get feedback as soon as possible, and at every stage thereafter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Come to us early with your idea</h2>
        <P>or; "we prefer great ideas over detailed spec document"</P>
        <P><I>"the message of the XP and Agile community was once 'professional programming is about the programmers and customers stupid' was what gave the movement teeth, and ever since then, the community has been trying to soften that blow";</I> By connecting developers (us) to clients (them) directly, we are better placed to really be agile than agencies with consultants and analysts, etc. </P>
        <P>Don't start building a spec for your product before coming to us, we don't do 'BDUF'.</P>
        <P>We work with you to make your idea a success, so don't be afraid to get in touch.</P>

        <h2>We only develop using agile</h2>
        <h3>What we mean by agile</h3>
        <P>Blah Blah</P>
        <h3>Why we only use agile</h3>
        <P>why we think it's the best option for the customer</P>

        <h3>An example of how it might work</h3>
        <P>should communicate:
          <ul>
            <li>breaking down features into stories</li>
            <li>building the simplest thing that could work</li>
            <li>evaluating</li>
            <li>deploying often</li>
            <li>their role in the developing the story</li>
            <li>prioritising</li>
          </ul>
        </P>

        <P><a href="http://agilemanifesto.org">Read more</a> at the agile manifesto website</P>

        <h2>Always a product</h2>
        <P>We always develop a product that can be released at every iteration. So you can always keep improving your product - well something along this lines</P>
        <P>Delivering working software gives visibility of our progress</P>
        <P>By starting with something simple and iterating towards the best solution is very powerful as you gain many advantages:
          <ul><li>This means that you'll be getting working software at least every week</li>
            <li>You'll be able to work with us flexibly, deciding when to start, stop and pause on work you want us to do</li>
            <li>You keep your options open and don't have to spend your money before you have to</li>
            <li>Further development based on feedback from someone actually using working software is so much more valuable than someone pontificating in abstract terms</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>We are a team of great developers</h2>
        <ul><li>fairly well known individuals, often with existing reputations and/or open-source kudos</li>
          <li>the first UK development supergroup?</li>
          <li>also, we work together well; complementary skills?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>You probably don't need a Facebook</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>improve existing systems and processes iteratively, rather than pitching new bespoke behemoths</li>
          <li>we don't want to oversell you something that isn't actually what you need</li>
          <li>our aim is to deliver tangible value as quickly as possible</li>
          <li>sometimes all you might need is something really simple, or a simple tweak to an existing process</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We expect to work in partnership towards a shared goal.</li>
          <li>We will challenge you and expect you to challenge us </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Quality &amp; Sustainability</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Even though we deliver working software at frequent intervals, we don't compromise on quality. </li>
          <li>his keeps the cost of change down and means we don't have to slow down.</li>
        </ul>

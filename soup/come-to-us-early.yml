<h2>Come to us early with your idea</h2>
<P>or; "we prefer great ideas over detailed spec document"</P>
<P><I>"the message of the XP and Agile community was once 'professional programming is about the programmers and customers stupid' was what gave the movement teeth, and ever since then, the community has been trying to soften that blow";</I> By connecting developers (us) to clients (them) directly, we are better placed to really be agile than agencies with consultants and analysts, etc. </P>
<P>Don't start building a spec for your product before coming to us, we don't do 'BDUF'.</P>
<P>We work with you to make your idea a success, so don't be afraid to get in touch.</P>

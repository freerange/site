  <h3>Software is alive</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>We know that software is not a static artefact and so cannot be described by a static spec or plan.</li>
    <li>It needs to grow and evolve according to its environment, to best suit the needs of its users.</li>
    <li>These needs change over time, even as the software is being built.</li>
    <li>By getting early and regular feedback from users in real scenarios, we can identify and fulfill these needs.</li>
    <li>By not compromising on quality and by avoiding unnecessary complexity, we can keep the system flexible and adaptable.</li>
  </ul>

        <h2>Play along</h2>
        <p>We're using the <a href="https://api.hashblue.com">#blue API</a> to print SMS messages as soon as they're received by <em>Timmy</em>, one of our test handsets.</p>
        <p>Try it yourself! <strong>Text us a message at +447716354419</strong>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://hashblue.com">#blue</a> is a beta service that <a href="http://gofreerange.com">we at Go Free Range</a> have been building for <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk">O2</a>. If you're an O2 customer, you can <a href="https://hashblue.com/">sign up today</a>.</a>
        <p><em>NOTE: while we're getting these messages directly from the API and internet, they do need to be received by the handset first, and that handset seems to be a bit flaky. If it takes a while for your SMS to appear, blame the Palm Pre!</em></p>

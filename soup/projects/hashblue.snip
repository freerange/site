[O2][] approached Go Free Range to explore new approaches to software development, database technologies and open collaboration with their customers. We built a working prototype / beta replicating one of [O2's existing products][Bluebook] which let customers access text messages online. Working iteratively, we designed and built an API to securely expose this data, and [#blue][], a front-end application which consumes this data.

Work has now begun on Phase 2, in which we will be scaling and integrating the service directly into O2's data network, allowing us to support hundreds of thousands of customers, whilst remaining responsive to the feedback and direction provided by the users of [#blue][].

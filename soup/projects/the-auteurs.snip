<p><a href="http://www.theauteurs.com">TheAuteurs.com</a> is an 'ongoing, online film festival', where you can watch choice films from around the world, and interact with other cineophiles to get great recommendations about what you should be watching. It's a great site which we use daily.</p>
<p>Free Range is collaborating with The Auteurs to bring new features to their community. As a significant and established application, we're also working to ensure that they can continue to rapidly develop their site without compromising on code quality.</p>

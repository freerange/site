Go Free Range is working with [Mudlark][] to build [Chromaroma][], a game you can play by travelling around London. 

Using an [Oyster card][] users swipe in and out of tube stations, ride the overground and jump on buses, accruing points for themselves and their team. 
The game includes missions, collections and achievements which can be unlocked via game mechanics such as location, time and speed. 

The game is currently in a closed alpha, but will be open to the public soon.

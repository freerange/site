### Software is alive
* We know that software is not a static artefact and so cannot be described by a static spec or plan.
* It needs to grow and evolve according to its environment, to best suit the needs of its users.
* These needs change over time, even as the software is being built.
* By getting early and regular feedback from users in real scenarios, we can identify and fulfill these needs.
* By not compromising on quality and by avoiding unnecessary complexity, we can keep the system flexible and adaptable.

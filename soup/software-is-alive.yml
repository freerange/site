<h2>Software is alive</h2>
<ul>
  <li>it's not a static artefact, so it can't be described by a static spec or plan</li>
  <li>it needs to grow and evolve according to its environment, to best suit the needs of its users. These needs change over time, even as the software is being built.</li>
  <li>the best way to do this is to get feedback as soon as possible, and at every stage thereafter</li>
</ul>

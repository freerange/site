Jason could be described as a _hybrid_, having worked in both design and programming roles. He now looks after our creative direction, user interfaces and front-end development of our projects where he gets to indulge his weird love for javascript. 

He has worked with The Walt Disney Company, Twentieth Century Fox, [Margaret Howell](http://www.margarethowell.co.uk), startups such as [Tipped](http://tipped.co.uk), [Threadme](http://threadme.co.uk) and [Ideapi](http://ideapi.com) some previous work can be seen at [Jase & Tonic](http://jaseandtonic.com).

Jason could be described as a _hybrid_, having worked in both design and programming roles. 

Now firmly seated as a designer; he looks after creative direction, user interface design and front-end development for our projects. 

He has worked with The Walt Disney Company, Twentieth Century Fox, [Margaret Howell](http://www.margarethowell.co.uk), startups such as [Tipped](http://tipped.co.uk), [Threadme](http://threadme.co.uk) and [Ideapi](http://ideapi.com).

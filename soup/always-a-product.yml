Always a product
-----
We always develop a product that can be released at every iteration. So you can always keep improving your product - well something along this lines

Delivering working software gives visibility of our progress

By starting with something simple and iterating towards the best solution is very powerful as you gain many advantages:

* This means that you'll be getting working software at least every week
* You'll be able to work with us flexibly, deciding when to start, stop and pause on work you want us to do
* You keep your options open and don't have to spend your money before you have to
* Further development based on feedback from someone actually using working software is so much more valuable than someone pontificating in abstract terms

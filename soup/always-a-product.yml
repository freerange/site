<h2>Always a product</h2>
<P>We always develop a product that can be released at every iteration. So you can always keep improving your product - well something along this lines</P>
<P>Delivering working software gives visibility of our progress</P>
<P>By starting with something simple and iterating towards the best solution is very powerful as you gain many advantages:
  <ul><li>This means that you'll be getting working software at least every week</li>
    <li>You'll be able to work with us flexibly, deciding when to start, stop and pause on work you want us to do</li>
    <li>You keep your options open and don't have to spend your money before you have to</li>
    <li>Further development based on feedback from someone actually using working software is so much more valuable than someone pontificating in abstract terms</li>
  </ul>

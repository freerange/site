A snip is the basic building block of information for {link_to vanilla-rb}. Essentially, it is a piece of content with arbitrary attributes. Vanilla anticipates the presence of some key attributes:

 * `name` - the name of the snip, which is how it will be referred to. The `name` of this snip is _snip_.
 * `content` - the default part of the snip to render. You can see the `content` of this snip <a href="/snip/content.raw">here</a>.
 * `render_as` - the name of the renderer to use when rendering the content. The `render_as` of this snip is {snip.render_as}.

One implementation of the snip store is {link_to soup}.
